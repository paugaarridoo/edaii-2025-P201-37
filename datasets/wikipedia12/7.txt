Bengal cat
The Bengal cat is a [breed](9) of hybrid [cat](0) created from crossing of an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. The breed's name derives from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

Bengals have varying appearances. Their coats range from spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, to marbling.
