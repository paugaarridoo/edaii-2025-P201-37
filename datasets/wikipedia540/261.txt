3-in-1 (fast food dish)
A 3-in-1, trio or three-in-one, is a fast-food dish consisting of chips, boiled rice (or egg fried rice), and curry sauce served in a single foil tray or plastic container. It became popular in Ireland as a dish from chip shops and Chinese restaurants in the early twenty-first century. It developed a cult-following in the 2010s, and media-outlets debated the merits of it compared to a spice bag which became popular around the same time.
Related dishes (four-, five-in one) contain additional ingredients such as chicken balls, or chicken or beef pieces.
