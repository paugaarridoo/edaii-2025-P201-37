1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum
A referendum on joining the European Economic Community was held in [Denmark](150) on 2 October 1972. The result was 63.3% in favour with a turnout of 90.1%. The law that [Denmark](150) should be member of the EEC was passed on 11 October 1972, and [Denmark](150) became a member on 1 January 1973.

Background
According to Article 20, section 2 of the Danish constitution, any law that makes limitations to the sovereignty of the Danish state (as membership of the EEC would) must be passed in the Danish parliament with 5/6 of the parliament's members voting for the law. If a majority of members vote for the law, but not by 5/6 majority, and the government wishes to uphold the suggested law, the law can still be passed in a public referendum, as was the case in the 1972 referendum.
According to a 2022 study, municipalities that experienced more German-inflicted violence during the German occupation of [Denmark](150) in WWII were more likely to vote against joining the EEC.
