1993 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum
A second referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was held in [Denmark](150) on 18 May 1993. After rejecting the treaty in a referendum the previous year, this time it was approved by 56.7% of voters with an 86.5% turnout.

Background
It was the second attempt to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, which could not come into effect unless ratified by all members of the [European Union](120). Thus, the Edinburgh Agreement granted [Denmark](150) four exceptions from the Maastricht Treaty, leading to its eventual ratification.

Results
By county
Aftermath
When the result of the referendum was announced, the outcome and frustrations about the referendum being held only a year after the Danes had rejected the previous treaty led to riots in the NÃ¸rrebro area of Copenhagen, during which police shot and wounded at least 11 people "to prevent an injured colleague being stoned to death". These 11 people, not in critical conditions, were subsequently treated for gunshot wounds as a result of the shooting. 90 police officers were injured during the riots.
