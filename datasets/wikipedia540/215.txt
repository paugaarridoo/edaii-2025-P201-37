1850s in association football
The following are events in the 1850s decade which are relevant to the development of association football. Included are events in closely related codes, such as the Sheffield Rules. All events happened in English football unless specified otherwise.

Events
1857
24 October – Foundation of Sheffield FC. The club is officially regarded by the FA and FIFA governing bodies as the world's oldest association football club. It is the oldest documented non-university club in any code of football.

1858
28 October – Final approval of the Laws of Sheffield [Football](200) Club which became known via several revisions as the Sheffield Rules. Originally created and maintained by Sheffield FC, responsibility for the rules passed to Sheffield & Hallamshire County [Football](200) Association upon its creation in 1867. They co-existed with the [Football](200) Association (FA) rules from 1863 until 1877 when the two codes were unified. The first version applied strict limits to handling of the ball but did allow the fair catch (earning a free kick). A goal could only be scored by kicking the ball, but not from a free kick. There was no offside rule but there were rules about the throw-in and the goal kick. There was no definition of goal size or structure, and no mention of team numbers. Besides carrying the ball by hand, certain other Rugby School practices were forbidden including hacking and holding opponents.

1859
Foundation of Wanderers FC by a group of Old Harrovians including Charles W. Alcock. The club was originally called Forest [Football](200) Club and changed its name to Wanderers in 1864.
