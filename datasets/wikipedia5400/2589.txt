Garden Peach
Garden Peach tomatoes are a cultivar of tomato, native South American fruit mainly from Peru. Its small, bright yellow fruit is the standard globe shape of tomato. With its yellow coloring, blushing vaguely pink mottling when very ripe, and fuzzy skin, it resembles a peach. This cultivar is also extremely prolific. It is rich in iron and vitamin B5. The plant grows naturally between 200 and 1,000 metres from Colombia to Ecuador and Perú.
Studies have shown they may lower cholesterol when eaten, or their juice drunk, regularly, similar to oranges or orange juice, but with a greater effect.
This heirloom is colored exactly like a peach and has a sweet mild flavor. Fruits are 2-4 oz. and perfect for salads. The vines are prolific and very easy to grow in poor soil. Garden Peaches have soft fuzzy skins and mature in 65 days on average. They are suited to containers.

Native people left a legacy that contributed to the discovery of the value of the species for medicinal purposes; it is currently used, although at incipient levels, to fight skin diseases and reduce cholesterol, glucose and uric acid levels in the blood (Silva Filho, 1998; Pardo, 2004).
