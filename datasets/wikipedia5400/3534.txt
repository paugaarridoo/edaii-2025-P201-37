BAFTA Rising Star Award
The EE British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Rising Star Award, currently styled as the EE Rising Star Award for commercial reasons and previously known as the Orange Rising Star Award, is an award that acknowledges new talents in the acting industry.
The five nominees are chosen regardless of gender, nationality and whether they have made a breakthrough in television, film or both. Despite the nominees being chosen by the BAFTA juries, the winner is chosen entirely by public votes via text, internet or phone. This award was sponsored by Orange UK until 2012 and has been sponsored by EE since 2013.

History
The award was created after Mary Selway died in 2004. She has been recognised for her successful role as a casting director and helped many new actors and actresses achieve fame.
The first winner was James McAvoy in 2006. Eva Green, Shia LaBeouf and Kristen Stewart have been the only non-British winners. The current holder of the award is Mia McKenna-Bruce, who won in 2023.
In the following lists, the titles and names in bold with a gold background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.
