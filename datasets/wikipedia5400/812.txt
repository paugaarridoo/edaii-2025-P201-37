Android Studio
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development. Android Studio is licensed under the Apache license but it ships with some SDK updates that are under a non-free license, making it not open source. 
Android Studio was announced on May 16, 2013, at the Google I/O conference. It was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014. The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0. At the end of 2015, Google dropped support for Eclipse ADT, making Android Studio the only officially supported IDE for Android development.
On May 7, 2019, Kotlin replaced Java as Google's preferred language for Android app development. Java is still supported, as is [C++](640).

Features
The following features are provided in the current stable version:

Gradle-based build support
Android-specific refactoring and quick fixes
Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility and other problems
ProGuard integration and app-signing capabilities
Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components
A rich layout editor that allows users to drag-and-drop UI components, option to preview layouts on multiple screen configurations
Support for building Android Wear apps
Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (Earlier 'Google Cloud Messaging') and Google App Engine
Android Virtual Device (Emulator) to run and debug apps in the Android studio.
Android Studio supports all the same programming languages of IntelliJ (and [CLion](865)) e.g. Java, [C++](640), and more with extensions, such as Go; and Android Studio 3.0 or later supports Kotlin, and "Android Studio includes support for using a number of Java 11+ [API](708)s without requiring a minimum [API](708) level for your app". External projects backport some Java 9 features. While IntelliJ states that Android Studio supports all released Java versions, and Java 12, it's not clear to what level Android Studio supports Java versions up to Java 12 (the documentation mentions partial Java 8 support). At least some new language features up to Java 12 are usable in Android.
Once an app has been compiled with Android Studio, it can be published on the Google Play Store. The application has to be in line with the Google Play Store developer content policy.

Version history
The following is a list of Android Studio's major releases:

System requirements
