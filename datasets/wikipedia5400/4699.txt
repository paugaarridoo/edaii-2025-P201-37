Chipewyan language
Chipewyan  or Dënesųłinë́ (ethnonym: Dënesųłinë́ yatié IPA: tènɛ̀sũ̀ɬìné jàtʰìɛ́), often simply called Dëne, is the language spoken by the Chipewyan people of northwestern [Canada](1956). It is categorized as part of the Northern Athabaskan language family. It has nearly 12,000 speakers in [Canada](1956), mostly in Saskatchewan, [Alberta](3213), Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. It has official status only in the Northwest Territories, alongside eight other aboriginal languages: Cree, Tlicho, Gwich'in, Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey and South Slavey.
