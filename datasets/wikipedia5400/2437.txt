AfroCan
The AfroCan (alternatively known as the FIBA AfroCan) is a men's basketball continental competition in [Africa](1700), which is played quadannually under the auspices of FIBA (International [Basketball](2400) Federation), basketball's international governing body, and the FIBA [Africa](1700)n zone thereof. Unlike the [AfroBasket](2435), AfroCan is only opened to all players who play for basketball clubs based in [Africa](1700).

History
In 2017, a new calendar by FIBA changed the [AfroBasket](2435) from a biennial to quadrennial tournament. As a consequence, the AfroCan was created to vill up the void.
The first ever AfroCan was held in 2019 in Mali, with DR Congo winning the inaugural title after beating Kenya in the final.
The second AfroCan was held in 2023 in [Angola](1855), with Morocco winning their first title after beating Ivory Coast in the final.
