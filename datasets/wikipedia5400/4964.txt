Book fairs
Scholastic Book Fairs began in 1981. Scholastic provides book fair products to schools, which then conduct the book fairs. Schools can elect to receive books, supplies and equipment or a portion of the proceeds from the book fair.
In the United States, during fiscal 2024, revenue from the book fairs channel ($541.6 million) accounted for more than half of the company's revenue in the "Total Children's Book Publishing and Distribution" segment ($955.2 million), and schools earned over $200 million in proceeds in cash and incentive credits.
In October 2023, Scholastic created a separate category for books dealing with "race, LGBTQ and other issues related to diversity", allowing schools to opt out of carrying these types of books. Scholastic defended the move, citing legislation in multiple states seeking to ban books dealing with LGBTQ issues or race. After public backlash from educators, authors, and free speech advocacy groups, Scholastic reversed course, saying the new category will be discontinued, writing: "It is unsettling that the current divisive landscape in the U.S. is creating an environment that could deny any child access to books, or that teachers could be penalized for creating access to all stories for their students".
Scholastic Book Fairs are viewed positively for promoting a love of reading among children, allowing students to discover their reading preferences, and providing some children with lasting positive memories associated with books and reading. However, the events face criticism for several reasons:

Unnecessary purchases: Encouragement of buying of toys and non-essential items, potentially wasting money and detracting from educational purposes.
Economic inequality and social pressure: Students who can't afford items have to watch as peers purchase freely, highlighting economic differences.
Forced attendance: Students are often required to attend the book fair during school hours, regardless of their ability to purchase.
Disrupted access: Normal library operations typically cease during the book fair, with shelves sometimes covered or removed.
Commercial presence: A for-profit company operating in a library space meant for free and equal access.

Book clubs
Scholastic book clubs are offered at schools in many countries. Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Reading Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Reading clubs are arranged by age/grade. Book club operators receive "Classroom Funds" redeemable only for Scholastic Corporation products.
