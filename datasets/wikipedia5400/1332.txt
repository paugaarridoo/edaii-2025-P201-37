Antalya Airport
Antalya Airport (IATA: AYT, ICAO: LTAI) is a major international airport located 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of the city centre of Antalya, Turkey. It is a major destination during the European summer leisure season due to its location at the country's Mediterranean coast. It handled 35,538,387 passengers in 2023, making it the third-busiest airport in Turkey, and one of the busiest airports in the Middle East. The airport has two international terminals and one domestic terminal. Antalya is one of the major airports in southwestern Turkey, the others being Bodrum and Dalaman. Among the top 50 busiest airports in the world by passenger numbers in 2021, Antalya saw the highest growth in passenger numbers at 125.8%. The airport's passenger numbers that year were among very few international airports to reach a level which matched or exceeded a normal operational year in the 2010s decade. The airport and its flights are estimated to have emitted 1.87 million tonnes of greenhouse gas in 2023.
