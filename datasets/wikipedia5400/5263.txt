Baghdad Jewish Arabic
[Baghdad](1667) Jewish [Arabic](4233) ([Arabic](4233): عربية يهودية بغدادية, עַרָבִיָּה יְהוּדִיַּה בַּגדָאדִיַּה) or autonym haki mal yihud (Jewish Speech) or el-haki malna (our speech) is the variety of [Arabic](4233) spoken by the Jews of [Baghdad](1667) and other towns of Lower Mesopotamia in Iraq. This dialect differs from the North Mesopotamian [Arabic](4233) spoken by Jews in Upper Mesopotamian cities such as Mosul and Anah. [Baghdad](1667)i and Northern Mesopotamian are subvarieties of Judeo-Iraqi [Arabic](4233).
As with most Judeo-[Arabic](4233) communities, there are likely to be few, if any, speakers of the Judeo-Iraqi [Arabic](4233) dialects who still reside within Iraq. Rather these dialects have been maintained or are facing critical endangerment within respective Judeo-Iraqi diasporas, namely those of Israel and the [United States](1100). In 2014, the film Farewell [Baghdad](1667) ([Arabic](4233): مطير الحمام; Hebrew: מפריח היונים, lit. 'The Dove Flyer'), which is performed mostly in Jewish [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233) dialect, became the first film to be almost completely performed in Judeo-Iraqi [Arabic](4233).

Classification
[Baghdad](1667) Jewish [Arabic](4233) (and [Baghdad](1667)i Christian [Arabic](4233)) resembles North Mesopotamian [Arabic](4233), and more distantly Syrian [Arabic](4233), rather than the [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233) spoken by [Baghdad](1667)i Muslims. Muslims speak a gilit dialect (from their pronunciation of the [Arabic](4233) word for "I said") while the others are qeltu dialects. Another resemblance between [Baghdad](1667) Jewish [Arabic](4233) and North Mesopotamian [Arabic](4233) is the pronunciation of ra as a uvular. This peculiarity goes back centuries: in medieval Iraqi Judaeo-[Arabic](4233) manuscripts the letters ra and ghayn are frequently interchanged.
It is thought that the qeltu dialects represent the older [Arabic](4233) dialect of Mesopotamia while the gilit dialect is of Bedouin origin. Another factor may be the northern origins of the Jewish community of [Baghdad](1667) after 1258 (see below under History).
Like Northern Mesopotamian and Syrian [Arabic](4233), Jewish [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233) shows some signs of an Aramaic substrate.  Violette Shamosh records that, at the Passover Seder, she could understand some of the passages in Aramaic but none of the passages in Hebrew.

History
The Mongol invasion wiped out most of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Later, the original qeltu [Baghdad](1667)i dialect became extinct as a result of massive Bedouin immigrations to Lower Mesopotamia and was replaced by the Bedouin influenced gilit dialect. The Jews of [Baghdad](1667) are a largely indigenous population and they also preserve the pre-Mongol invasion dialect of [Baghdad](1667) in its Jewish form, which is similar but a bit different from the general pre-Mongol [Baghdad](1667)i dialect due to the linguistic influences of Hebrew and Judeo-Babylonian Aramaic, instead of the general Babylonian Aramaic that existed before the Islamic invasion.
As with other respective religious and ethnic communities coexisting in [Baghdad](1667), the Jewish community had spoken as well as written almost exclusively in their distinctive dialect, largely drawing their linguistic influences from Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic languages as well as from languages such as Sumerian, Akkadian, Persian, and Turkic. Simultaneous fluency and literacy in the [Arabic](4233) used by the dominant Muslim communities had also been commonplace.
With waves of persecution and thus emigration, the dialect has been carried to and until recently used within respective Judeo-Iraqi diaspora communities, spanning Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Manchester and numerous other international urban hubs. After the mass emigration of Jews from Iraq to Israel between the 1940s and 1960s, Israel came to hold the single largest linguistic community of Judeo-Iraqi [Arabic](4233) speakers. With successive generations being born and raised in Israel, it is mainly the older people who still actively or passively speak Judeo-[Baghdad](1667)i and other forms of Judeo-Iraqi [Arabic](4233). Israelis of Iraqi descent in turn are largely unilingual Modern Hebrew speakers.

Orthography
The Jews of [Baghdad](1667) also have a written Judeo-[Arabic](4233) that differs from the spoken language and uses Hebrew characters.  There is a sizeable published religious literature in the language, including several Bible translations and the Qanūn an-nisā' (قانون النساء) of the hakham Yosef Hayyim.
The following method of describing the letters of the Hebrew alphabet was used by teachers in [Baghdad](1667) until quite recently:

Phonology
Consonants
JB is relatively conservative in preserving Classical [Arabic](4233) phonemes. Classical [Arabic](4233) /q/ has remained as a uvular (or post-velar) stop, like Christian [Baghdad](1667) [Arabic](4233), but unlike in Muslim [Baghdad](1667) [Arabic](4233) where it is pronounced as ɡ. /k/ is retained as k, like in Christian [Baghdad](1667)i, but unlike the Muslim dialect where it is sometimes tʃ. Classical [Arabic](4233) interdental /ð, θ, ðˠ/ are preserved, like in Muslim [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233) (Christian [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233) merges them into /d, t, dˤ/). /dˤ/ has merged into /ðˠ/.
There are a few rare minimal pairs with /lˠ, bˠ/ (e.g. wáḷḷa 'by God! (an oath)' vs. wálla 'he went away', ḅāḅa 'father, dad' vs. bāba 'her door'). In other words, there are velarized segments which cannot be demonstrated to be phonemic, but which cannot be substituted, e.g. ṃāṃa 'mother, mummy'. There is a certain degree of velarization harmony.
/r/ is one of the primary distinguishing features of Jewish (as opposed to Muslim, but not Christian) [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233). Older [Arabic](4233) /r/ has shifted to /ɣ/ (as in Christian, but not Muslim, [Baghdad](1667)i [Arabic](4233)). However /r/ has been re-introduced in non-[Arabic](4233) loans (e.g. brāxa 'blessing' < Heb. ברכה, qūri 'teapot' < Pers. qūrī). Modern loan words from other [Arabic](4233) dialects also have this sound; this sometimes leads to cases where the same word may have two forms depending on context, e.g. ʿáskaġ 'army' vs. ḥākəm ʿáskari 'martial law'. There are many instances where this alternation leads to a subtle change in meaning, e.g. faġġ 'he poured, served food' vs. farr 'he threw'.
The consonants /p, ɡ, tʃ/ were originally of foreign origin, but have pervaded the language to the extent that native speakers do not perceive or even realize their non-native origin.

Vowels
Suprasegmentals
Stress is usually on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, but sometimes on the antipenultimate (mostly in loans or compound words).
