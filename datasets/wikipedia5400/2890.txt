In the category of phytochemicals that can be found in food, there are :

α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
Caffeic acid – burdock, hawthorn, artichoke, pear, basil, thyme, oregano, apple
Cichoric acid
Cinnamic acid – aloe
Chlorogenic acid – echinacea, strawberries, pineapple, coffee, sunflower, blueberries
Diferulic acids
Coumaric acid
Ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) – oats, rice, artichoke, orange, pineapple, apple, peanut
Sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or sinapic acid)

Hydroxycinnamoyltartaric acids
Caftaric acid – grapes and wine, mainly the trans isomer
Coutaric acid – grapes and wine, both trans and cis isomers
Fertaric acid – grapes and wine, mainly the trans isomer
