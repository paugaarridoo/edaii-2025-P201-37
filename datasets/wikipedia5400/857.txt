C++Builder
[C++](640)Builder is a rapid application development (RAD) environment for developing software in the [C++](640) programming language. Originally developed by Borland, as of 2009 it is owned by Embarcadero Technologies, a subsidiary of Idera. [C++](640)Builder can compile apps for Windows (both IA-32 and x64), iOS, macOS, and Android (32-bit only). It includes tools that allow drag-and-drop visual development, making programming easier by incorporating a WYSIWYG graphical user interface builder.
[C++](640)Builder is the sibling product of Delphi, an IDE that uses the Object Pascal programming language. [C++](640)Builder combines the Visual Component Library (VCL) and IDE written in Object Pascal with multiple [C++](640) compilers. [C++](640)Builder and Delphi can generate mutually compatible binaries. [C++](640) methods can call Object Pascal methods and vice versa. Since both Delphi and [C++](640) use the same back-end linker, the debugger can  step from Delphi code into [C++](640) transparently. In addition, [C++](640)Builder projects can include Delphi code. (The reverse is not possible.)

Technology
[C++](640)Builder uses the same IDE as Delphi, and shares many core libraries.  Notable shared Delphi (Object Pascal code) and [C++](640) Builder routines include the FastMM4 memory manager, which was developed as a community effort within the FastCode project, the entire UI framework known as the VCL, which is written in Object Pascal, as well as base system routines, many of which have been optimised for both Delphi and [C++](640)Builder through the FastCode project.
[C++](640)Builder projects can include Delphi code. The Delphi compiler emits [C++](640) headers, allowing [C++](640) code to link to Delphi classes and methods as though they were written in [C++](640). The reverse ([C++](640) code being used by Delphi) is not as straightforward but possible.
[C++](640)Builder originally targeted only the Microsoft Windows platform. Later versions incorporated Borland CLX, a cross-platform development visual component library based on Qt, that supports Windows and Linux, however CLX is now abandoned. The current version by Embarcadero supports cross-platform development using the new Firemonkey (FMX) library.

Editions
[C++](640) Builder is available in four editions with increasing features and price:

Community: Available for free for one year but has a limited commercial-use license.  Includes local database connectivity and some library source code.
Professional: Adds cross-platform compilation for macOS, (until version 10.2.2: iOS and Android requiring the purchase of the additional Mobile Add-On pack), more library source code, code formatting, and a full commercial license.
Enterprise: Includes the mobile target platforms and adds client/server database connectivity, Enterprise Mobility Services, and DataSnap multi-tier SDK.
Architect: Adds data modeling tools.

History
Traditionally, the release cycle was such that Delphi got major enhancements first, with [C++](640)Builder following, though recent versions have been released at the same time as their Delphi equivalents.

1.0
Borland announced the preview version of [C++](640)Builder 1.0 on January 7, 1997. The company released a retail version on February 26, 1997, in three editions: "Standard," "Professional," and "Client/Server Suite."

3.0
Borland skipped the 2.0 version number to align [C++](640)Builder with its Delphi version numbering.

4.0
New features include:

Integrated Inprise Corporation's VisiBroker 3.3 with event and naming services
New multi-standard flexible [C++](640) compiler

5.0
On March 22, 2000, Inprise Corporation announced the release of Borland [C++](640)Builder 5, available in Enterprise, Professional, Standard editions. New features include:

Support of Windows 2000.

[C++](640)BuilderX
On Sep 15, 2003, Borland Software Corporation announced the release of Borland [C++](640)BuilderX (CBX), which was also included as part of the latest Borland Enterprise Studio for Mobile. CBX was written using the same framework as JBuilder and bore little resemblance to either [C++](640)Builder or Delphi. This product was aimed at developing large programs for enterprises, but did not sell well.
On Sep 22, 2003, Borland Software Corporation and PalmSource, Inc. announced Borland has licensed the PalmSource software development kits (SDKs) and will support Palm OS development in the Borland [C++](640)BuilderX Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and latest Borland Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solutions for [C++](640).
At the end of 2004 Borland announced that it would continue to develop the earlier [C++](640)Builder and bundle it with the Delphi development suite, abandoning [C++](640)BuilderX.

2006
On Oct 10, 2005, Borland announced the release of [C++](640)Builder 2006 (previously codenamed "DeXter"). Minimum supported operating system was changed to Windows 2000.
About a year after the announcement, the company released Borland Developer Studio 2006, which includes Borland [C++](640)Builder 2006, with improved configuration management and bug fixes. Borland Developer Studio 2006 is a single package containing Delphi, [C++](640)Builder, and C#Builder.

2007
In 2006 Borland's Developer Tools Group, developers of [C++](640)Builder, was transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary, CodeGear.
June 5, 2007, CodeGear released [C++](640)Builder 2007, providing:

Full API support for Microsoft Windows Vista including themed applications and seamless VCL support for Aero and Vista Desktop

CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 incorporates [C++](640)Builder 2007 and Delphi. Also in 2007 Borland revived the "Turbo" brand and released two "Turbo" editions of [C++](640)Builder: Turbo [C++](640) Professional, and Turbo [C++](640) Explorer (no longer available from CodeGear), based on Borland [C++](640)Builder 2006.
In 2008 CodeGear was purchased by Embarcadero Technologies, who continued development.
