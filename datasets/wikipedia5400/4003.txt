Arthur C. Cope
Arthur C. Cope (June 27, 1909 – June 4, 1966) was an American organic chemist and member of the [United States](1100) National Academy of Sciences.  He is credited with the development of several important chemical reactions which bear his name including the [Cope elimination](4064) and the [Cope rearrangement](4065).
Cope was born on June 27, 1909, in [Dunreith, Indiana](4071).  He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from [Butler University](4047) in Indianapolis in 1929 and a PhD in 1932 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.  His research continued at Harvard University in 1933 as a National Research Council Fellow.  In 1934, he joined the faculty of [Bryn Mawr College](4046).  There, his research included the first syntheses of a number of barbiturates including delvinyl sodium.  At Bryn Mawr, Cope also developed a reaction involving the thermal rearrangement of an allyl group which eventually became known as the [Cope rearrangement](4065).
In 1941, Cope moved to [Columbia University](2080) where he worked on projects associated with the war effect including chemical warfare agents, antimalarial drugs, and treatments for mustard gas poisoning. In 1945, he moved to the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](4006) to become the head of the Department of Chemistry.
