[Asia](1914) Times (Chinese: 亞洲時報), formerly known as [Asia](1914) Times Online, is a Hong Kong–based [English language](4401) news media publishing group, covering politics, economics, business, and culture from an [Asia](1914)n perspective. [Asia](1914) Times publishes in English and simplified Chinese.

History
The Hong Kong website is self-described successor to Bangkok-based print newspaper [Asia](1914) Times that was launched in 1995 and closed in mid-1997, using the domain asiatimes.com.
[Asia](1914) Times Online was created early in 1999, at atimes.com, describing itself as a successor in "publication policy and editorial outlook" to the print newspaper [Asia](1914) Times, owned by Sondhi Limthongkul, a Thai media mogul and leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy, who later sold his business.
The new publishing company is [Asia](1914) Times Holdings Limited, incorporated and registered in Hong Kong. Many reporters from the [Asia](1914) Times print edition continued their careers as journalists, and a group of those contributors created [Asia](1914) Times Online as a successor to the [Asia](1914) Times. The word "Online" is no longer part of the website news portal.
In 2006, The New York Times described [Asia](1914) Times Online as "one of the most prominent of the English-language regional publications" covering [Asia](1914).
The site was relaunched with a new logo and design in October 2016 with Uwe Parpart as editor. Other executives include Cecil Ho, former chief financial officer of ReOrient Group Limited.
The site was again relaunched in February 2019 with a refreshed web design, multiple languages and a domain name change to asiatimes.com. According to its "About" page, [Asia](1914) Times has "two main newsrooms and social media hubs... in Bangkok and Hong Kong...supported by bureaus in Seoul, Beijing, Singapore, and New York."
