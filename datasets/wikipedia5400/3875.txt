Babylonian mathematics
[Babylonia](338)n mathematics (also known as Assyro-[Babylonia](338)n mathematics) is the mathematics developed or practiced by the people of Mesopotamia, as attested by sources mainly surviving from the Old [Babylonia](338)n period (1830‚Äì1531 BC) to the Seleucid from the last three or four centuries BC. With respect to content, there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts. [Babylonia](338)n mathematics remained constant, in character and content, for over a millennium.
In contrast to the scarcity of sources in Egyptian mathematics, knowledge of [Babylonia](338)n mathematics is derived from hundreds of clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in cuneiform, tablets were inscribed while the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. The majority of recovered clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics that include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations and the Pythagorean theorem. The [Babylonia](338)n tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of 
  
    
      
        
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}
  
 accurate to three significant sexagesimal digits (about six significant decimal digits).

Origins of [Babylonia](338)n mathematics
[Babylonia](338)n mathematics is a range of numeric and more advanced mathematical practices in the ancient Near East, written in cuneiform script. Study has historically focused on the First [Babylonia](338)n dynasty old [Babylonia](338)n period in the early second millennium BC due to the wealth of data available. There has been debate over the earliest appearance of [Babylonia](338)n mathematics, with historians suggesting a range of dates between the 5th and 3rd millennia BC. [Babylonia](338)n mathematics was primarily written on clay tablets in cuneiform script in the Akkadian or Sumerian languages.
"[Babylonia](338)n mathematics" is perhaps an unhelpful term since the earliest suggested origins date to the use of accounting devices, such as bullae and tokens, in the 5th millennium BC.

[Babylonia](338)n numerals
The [Babylonia](338)n system of mathematics was a sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system. From this we derive the modern-day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 degrees in a circle. The [Babylonia](338)ns were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a superior highly composite number, having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 (including those that are themselves composite), facilitating calculations with fractions. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the [Babylonia](338)ns had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much as, in our base ten system, 734 = 7√ó100 + 3√ó10 + 4√ó1).

Old [Babylonia](338)n mathematics (2000‚Äì1600 BC)
[Arithmetic](820)
The [Babylonia](338)ns used pre-calculated tables to assist with arithmetic. For example, two tablets found at Senkerah on the Euphrates in 1854, dating from 2000 BC, give lists of the squares of numbers up to 59 and the cubes of numbers up to 32. The [Babylonia](338)ns used the lists of squares together with the formulae:

  
    
      
        a
        b
        =
        
          
            
              (
              a
              +
              b
              
                )
                
                  2
                
              
              ‚àí
              
                a
                
                  2
                
              
              ‚àí
              
                b
                
                  2
                
              
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle ab={\frac {(a+b)^{2}-a^{2}-b^{2}}{2}}}
  

  
    
      
        a
        b
        =
        
          
            
              (
              a
              +
              b
              
                )
                
                  2
                
              
              ‚àí
              (
              a
              ‚àí
              b
              
                )
                
                  2
                
              
            
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle ab={\frac {(a+b)^{2}-(a-b)^{2}}{4}}}
  

to simplify multiplication.
The [Babylonia](338)ns did not have an algorithm for long division. Instead they based their method on the fact that:

  
    
      
        
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =
        a
        √ó
        
          
            1
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}=a\times {\frac {1}{b}}}
  

together with a table of reciprocals. Numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5 (known as 5-smooth or regular numbers) have finite reciprocals in sexagesimal notation, and tables with extensive lists of these reciprocals have been found.
Reciprocals such as 1/7, 1/11, 1/13, etc. do not have finite representations in sexagesimal notation. To compute 1/13 or to divide a number by 13 the [Babylonia](338)ns would use an approximation such as:

  
    
      
        
          
            1
            13
          
        
        =
        
          
            7
            91
          
        
        =

        =

        √ó
        
          
            40
            3600
          
        
        =
        
          
            280
            3600
          
        
        =
        
          
            4
            60

    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{13}}={\frac {7}{91}}=7\times {\frac {1}{91}}\approx 7\times {\frac {1}{90}}=7\times {\frac {40}{3600}}={\frac {280}{3600}}={\frac {4}{60}}+{\frac {40}{3600}}.}

[Algebra](719)
The [Babylonia](338)n clay tablet YBC 7289 (c.‚Äâ1800‚Äì1600 BC) gives an approximation of ‚àö2 in four sexagesimal figures, íêï íåãíåãíêº íêêíêï íåã = 1;24,51,10, which is accurate to about six decimal digits, and is the closest possible three-place sexagesimal representation of ‚àö2:

  
    
      
        1
        +

        =
        
          
            30547
            21600
          
        
        =
        1.41421
        
          
            296
            ¬Ø
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1+{\frac {24}{60}}+{\frac {51}{60^{2}}}+{\frac {10}{60^{3}}}={\frac {30547}{21600}}=1.41421{\overline {296}}.}
  

As well as arithmetical calculations, [Babylonia](338)n mathematicians also developed algebraic methods of solving equations. Once again, these were based on pre-calculated tables.
To solve a quadratic equation, the [Babylonia](338)ns essentially used the standard quadratic formula. They considered quadratic equations of the form:

  
    
      
         
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        +
        b
        x
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ x^{2}+bx=c}
  

where b and c were not necessarily integers, but c was always positive. They knew that a solution to this form of equation is:

  
    
      
        x
        =
        ‚àí
        
          
            b
            2
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              
                (
                
                  
                    b
                    2
                  
                
                )
              
              
                2
              
            
            +
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=-{\frac {b}{2}}+{\sqrt {\left({\frac {b}{2}}\right)^{2}+c}}}
  

and they found square roots efficiently using division and averaging. Problems of this type included finding the dimensions of a rectangle given its area and the amount by which the length exceeds the width.
Tables of values of n3 + n2 were used to solve certain cubic equations. For example, consider the equation:

  
    
      
         
        a
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        +
        b
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        =
        c
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ ax^{3}+bx^{2}=c.}
  

Multiplying the equation by a2 and dividing by b3 gives:

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              
                
                  a
                  x
                
                b
              
            
            )
          
          
            3
          
        
        +
        
          
            (
            
              
                
                  a
                  x
                
                b
              
            
            )
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              c
              
                a
                
                  2
                
              
            
            
              b
              
                3
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {ax}{b}}\right)^{3}+\left({\frac {ax}{b}}\right)^{2}={\frac {ca^{2}}{b^{3}}}.}
  

Substituting y = ax/b gives:

  
    
      
        
          y
          
            3
          
        
        +
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              c
              
                a
                
                  2
                
              
            
            
              b
              
                3
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{3}+y^{2}={\frac {ca^{2}}{b^{3}}}}
  

which could now be solved by looking up the n3 + n2 table to find the value closest to the right-hand side. The [Babylonia](338)ns accomplished this without algebraic notation, showing a remarkable depth of understanding. However, they did not have a method for solving the general cubic equation.

Growth
[Babylonia](338)ns modeled exponential growth, constrained growth (via a form of sigmoid functions), and doubling time, the latter in the context of interest on loans.
Clay tablets from c. 2000 BC include the exercise "Given an interest rate of 1/60 per month (no compounding), compute the doubling time." This yields an annual interest rate of 12/60 = 20%, and hence a doubling time of 100% growth/20% growth per year = 5 years.

Plimpton 322
The Plimpton 322 tablet contains a list of "Pythagorean triples", i.e., integers 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b,c)}
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        +
        
          b
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}
  
.
The triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force.
Much has been written on the subject, including some speculation (perhaps anachronistic) as to whether the tablet could have served as an early trigonometrical table. Care must be exercised to see the tablet in terms of methods familiar or accessible to scribes at the time.

... the question "how was the tablet calculated?" does not have to have the
same answer as the question "what problems does the tablet set?" The first can be answered
most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second
by some sort of right-triangle problems.

Geometry
[Babylonia](338)ns knew the common rules for measuring volumes and areas. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if œÄ is estimated as 3. They were aware that this was an approximation, and one Old [Babylonia](338)n mathematical tablet excavated near Susa in 1936 (dated to between the 19th and 17th centuries BC) gives a better approximation of œÄ as 25/8 = 3.125, about 0.5 percent below the exact value.
The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The Pythagorean rule was also known to the [Babylonia](338)ns.
The "[Babylonia](338)n mile" was a measure of distance equal to about 11.3 km (or about seven modern miles).
This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a "time-mile" used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.
The [Babylonia](338)n astronomers kept detailed records of the rising and setting of stars, the motion of the planets, and the solar and lunar eclipses, all of which required familiarity with angular distances measured on the celestial sphere.
They also used a form of Fourier analysis to compute an ephemeris (table of astronomical positions), which was discovered in the 1950s by Otto Neugebauer. To make calculations of the movements of celestial bodies, the [Babylonia](338)ns used basic arithmetic and a coordinate system based on the ecliptic, the part of the heavens that the sun and planets travel through.
Tablets kept in the British Museum provide evidence that the [Babylonia](338)ns even went so far as to have a concept of objects in an abstract mathematical space. The tablets date from between 350 and 50 B.C.E., revealing that the [Babylonia](338)ns understood and used geometry even earlier than previously thought. The [Babylonia](338)ns used a method for estimating the area under a curve by drawing a trapezoid underneath, a technique previously believed to have originated in 14th century Europe. This method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance Jupiter had traveled in a certain amount of time.
