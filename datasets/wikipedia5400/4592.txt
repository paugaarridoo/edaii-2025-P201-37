Canton of Bern
The canton of [Bern](3499), or [Bern](3499)e (German: Kanton [Bern](3499); French: canton de [Bern](3499)e; Romansh: Chantun [Bern](3499)a; Italian: Canton [Bern](3499)a), is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. Its capital city, [Bern](3499), is also the de facto capital of Switzerland. The bear is the heraldic symbol of the canton, displayed on a red-yellow background.
Comprising ten districts, [Bern](3499) is the second-largest canton by both surface area and population. Located in west-central Switzerland, it is surrounded by eleven cantons. It borders the cantons of Jura and Solothurn to the north. To the west lie the cantons of Neuchâtel, Fribourg, and Vaud. To the south lies the cantons of Valais. East of the canton of [Bern](3499) lie the cantons of Uri, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Lucerne and Aargau. The geography of the canton includes a large share of all three natural regions of Switzerland: the Jura Mountains (the [Bern](3499)ese Jura), the Swiss Plateau (the [Bern](3499)ese Mittelland) and the [Alps](1324) (the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland).
The canton of [Bern](3499) is bilingual, officially German- and French-speaking, and has a population (as of 31 December 2020) of 1,043,132. The largest city, [Bern](3499), is also the seat of the federal government of Switzerland. Other major cities are Thun and Biel/Bienne. The canton is also renowned for its numerous Alpine resort towns, notably Interlaken and Gstaad.
Formerly part of the [Holy Roman Empire](2250), the canton of [Bern](3499) entered an alliance with the Swiss Forest Cantons in 1323 and joined the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1353.

History
[Bern](3499) joined the Old Swiss Confederation in 1353. Between 1803 and 1814 it was one of the six directorial cantons of the Napoleonic Swiss Confederation.

Early prehistory
The earliest traces of a human presence in the area of the modern Canton is found in three caves in the Simmental region; Schnurenloch near Oberwil, Ranggiloch above Boltigen and Chilchlihöhle above Erlenbach. These caves were used at various times during the last ice age. The first open-air settlement in the area is an upper paleolithic settlement at Moosbühl in Moosseedorf. During the warmer climate of the mesolithic period, increasing forest cover restricted the movement of hunters, fishers and gatherers. Their temporary settlements were built along lake and marsh edges, which remained free of trees due to fluctuations in water level. Important mesolithic sites in the Canton are at Pieterlenmoos and Burgäschisee lake along with alpine valleys at Diemtig and Simmental. During the neolithic period, there were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Biel, the Toteisbecken (Lobsigensee, Moossee, Burgäschisee and Inkwilersee) and along rivers (Aare, Zihl). Several of these sites are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the [Alps](1324), a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
One of the best explored neolithic sites is at Twann (now Twann-Tüscherz). In the Twannbach delta there were about 25 Cortaillod culture and Horgen culture villages that existed between 3800 and 2950 BC. One of the oldest examples of bread from Switzerland, a sourdough from 3560 to 3530 BC, came from one of these villages. A preserved Bronze Age dugout boat has been found on the dried out lake bed, it was part of lake village near Twann, a stone-lined well had been dug near the preserved boat in 1874.

Iron Age
During the Early Iron Age changes in climate forced the Hallstatt culture (800–450 BCE) to abandon settlements along many waterways and in the valley floors and move to the plateaus and hills. With increased trade contacts across the [Alps](1324), the cultural influence of the Mediterranean region grew in the area. Evidence of this trade include a hydria which was discovered in Grächwil. Burial rituals and social classes became more developed during this time. The so-called princely graves became more common, many of the burial mounds were over 30 m (98 ft) in diameter and 4 m (13 ft) high and richly outfitted with grave goods. In a grave mound in Bützberg the first burial in the mound was followed by several later burials. Often, several grave mounds combined to become a necropolis, such as at Grossaffoltern, Ins, Bannwil, Langenthal and Bützberg. Most of the knowledge about the Hallstatt culture in the Canton comes from graves. The only discovered settlement is around Blanche Church in La Neuveville.
The grave goods show that iron was forged into swords, daggers, spearheads, knives and wagon accessories. Gold, which was probably collected from river sand, was made into diadems, rings and pendants. Thin bronze arm, leg and neck plates with geometric designs were often buried, especially in the graves at Allenlüften in Mühleberg, at Ins and at Bützberg. The jewelry that was buried included bracelets and rings which were also made of jet and lignite coal. At Münchringen, the grave pottery was both shaped by hand or thrown on a potter's wheel, and was painted with multi-colored ornamentation.
The transition to the Late Iron Age of the La Tène culture (450−1st century BCE) is indicated by a sudden change of style in the metalworking and ceramic industries. Numerous graves (from unknown settlements), along with the two oppida at [Bern](3499)-Engehalbinsel and Jensberg by Studen, mark the population centers during the late Iron Age. Gold coins (from Melchnau) along with silver and bronze coins first start to appear during this era. A sword with Greek characters that said Korisios was found at the Port site. At the oppidum at [Bern](3499)-Engehalbinsel, there were studios for glass and ceramic production, and iron working achieved a high level of skill, along with craftsmen who worked in wood, leather and goldsmithing. There was a nearby place of worship in the Bremgarten wood, and cemeteries at Münsingen and [Bern](3499)-Engehalbinsel.

Roman era
After the Roman era victory at Battle of Bibracte in 58 BCE, the Helvetii were forced to return to their homes as foederati of the Romans. Under increasing Roman influence, the local economy and trade flourished. The main settlements lay at the foot of the Jura Mountains and on the Central Plateau.
The existing roads were expanded, especially the Aventicum-Vindonissa and the Petinesca-Augusta Raurica roads. A fourth alpine pass, the Rawil pass, was added to the traditional three; the Grimsel, Brünig and Susten passes. In the [Bern](3499)ese Jura the Mont Raimeux and Pierre Pertuis passes opened.
Under the Romans, many of the old fortified places were expanded and refortified. The old Helvetii oppidum at the Engehalbinsel became a Roman vicus, which was probably known as Brenodor or Brenodurum. At the foot of the Jens mountain, the fort Petinesca was built to guard the roads over the Jura Mountains. This was reinforced in the late-Roman era (368–369 CE) by a fortified bridge over the Thielle/Zihl river between Aegerten and Brügg.
A number of Roman villas were built around the Canton. At Oberwichtrach both the main building (pars urbana) and the industrial section (pars rustica) of a Roman villa have been discovered. The villas at Münsingen, Toffen and Herzogenbuchsee have richly detailed Roman mosaics that are still partly visible.
The religious practices of the local population merged with Roman beliefs and the Canton of [Bern](3499) is home to a number of unique cult centers. They include the larger than life statues of gods (including enthroned Jupiter) at Petinesca, Engehalbinsel, and Thun-Allmendingen; and a number of stone inscriptions. At the beginning of the 5th century CE, Rome withdrew its troops from the Rhine garrisons, but allowed the [Burgundians](4587) to settle on Helvetii lands in 443 CE.

Early Middle Ages
East of the Aare, the transition from the Gallo-Roman dominated population to a Germanic population in the Early Middle Ages happened relatively peacefully. One exception was the Battle of Wangen in 610, but elsewhere it generally was a slow process of cultural infiltration. By the 7th century, the Alamannic settlers had already taken most of the good locations southeast of the Aare and they began moving up the Aare to the regions of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. All areas west of the Aare belonged to the romanised Burgundian kingdom, which became part of the Merovingian Frankish kingdom in the 534. During the Carolingian era, the political structure of the Franks had spread into parts of what became Switzerland. In 762/778 the County of Aargau was founded, followed in 861 by the County of Oberaargau and in 965 the County of Bargen. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 put the border between Central and Eastern Frankish Empires at the Aare, and divided the Aare region in half. The population west of the Aare generally spoke a Romance language, while those to the east spoke a Germanic language. The region between the rivers Saane and Aare became the language border.
Christianity spread slowly into the Aare valley. The dioceses of [Lausanne](3913), [Basel](1372), Sion, Chur and Constance were all established before the new faith made inroads into the valley. The Aare valley was bordered by three dioceses; [Lausanne](3913), Constance and [Basel](1372). However, the first Christian missionaries came into the valley from [Alsace](4518) and other western areas. In 630 the Abbey of Luxeuil established the Abbey of Moutier-Grandval along the old transit route through the Pierre Pertuis Pass. By the 9th or 10th century, this abbey had property and influence all the way to Lake Biel and into the Balsthal valley. The first monastic cells of what would become the Abbey of Saint-Imier was also founded in 600. In the Seeland and Aare valleys, wooden churches were first built during the Merovingian period. The current churches in Kirchlindach, Oberwil bei Buren and Bleibach were all built above the ruins of these early churches. About 30 churches in the [Bern](3499) and Solothurn portions of the Aare valley were created over ruins of Roman villas and subsequent burial grounds in the 7th century (including Meikirch and Oberbipp). In Mett, the church was built over a 5th-century mausoleum, which was built over a 4th-century tomb. In 700, six sarcophagi were buried on St. Peter's Island next to a Roman temple complex. A wooden monastery was built over the complex in the 8th–9th century.

Middle Ages
During the 10th century, the Aare valley came fully under the Second Kingdom of Burgundy. Under King Rudolph I and his son Rudolph II Burgundy's influence reached across most of modern Switzerland. They established royal courts at Bümpliz, Münsingen, Uetendorf, Wimmis, Kirchberg and Utzenstorf to allow them to govern the Aare valley. Later, the Aare valley moved toward closer ties with the [Holy Roman Empire](2250) during the Ottonian and Salian dynasties.
The succession dispute following the death of Rudolph III in 1032 allowed the Salian kings to acquire the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy and with it the Aare valley. As a part of the [Holy Roman Empire](2250), the valley was involved when the Investiture Controversy broke out in 1056. In 1077, the Regent of Burgundy, Count Rudolf of Rheinfelden, declared himself as an anti-king against King Henry IV. The Bishops of [Basel](1372) and [Lausanne](3913) remained loyal to King Henry IV, and took the Rheinfelden lands in Oberaargau and the upper Aare valley. After Rudolf's death in 1090, his lands went to his son, Berchtold II of Zähringen. He and his son, Berchtold III, tried to use these lands to expand their power. In 1127 the Zähringer were appointed Rector or delegate of the king in Burgundy. Their hopes for a new, independent Burgundy were dashed in 1156, and the last Zähringen count, Berchtold V, embarked on a program of city founding. The cities of Burgdorf, Murten, Thun and [Bern](3499) were all founded by Berchtold V. When he died without an heir, the Zähringen lands went to the House of Kyburg, while the offices and fiefs reverted to the empire.
During the High Middle Ages both the Aare valley and the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland were divided into a number of small counties, each with their own baron. Nobles from the [Holy Roman Empire](2250) began to marry into the local noble families and a number of the Zähringen Ministerialis families (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) moved into the Oberland. The nobles also began to found monasteries to spread their power into the Oberland. During the period between 1070 and 1150, at least ten large monasteries were founded by local nobles. These include; the Cluniac Priory of Rüeggisberg (Lords of Rümligen in 1072), Münchenwiler (Wiler family in 1080), St. Peter's Island (Count of Hochburgund-Mâcon in the late 11th century), Hettiswil (1107), Röthenbach im Emmental (Lords of Rümligen or Signau), the [Benedictine](3340) monastery at St. Johannsen in Erlach (Fenis family in 1100), Trub (Lords of Lützelflüh before 1130) and Rüegsau (possibly also the Lords of Lützelflüh in first half of the 12th century), the Augustinian Collegiate church in Interlaken (Oberhofen family in 1130) and the Cistercian Frienisberg Abbey (Count Saugern around 1130). However, in 1191 the Oberland barons revolted against Berchtold V of Zähringen and many of the Oberland barons were killed in the battle of Grindelwald.
During the 13th century a number of the cities near [Bern](3499) were granted the city right and appointed mayors and city councils. [Bern](3499) became an imperial city. During the mid-13th century, the Empire's presence weakened in the Aare valley, forcing the local nobles to find allies to protect themselves. [Bern](3499) entered into a number of treaties with its neighbors in the 13th century. In 1274, the Emperor Rudolph I of Habsburg, confirmed [Bern](3499)'s imperial immediacy. However, in 1285 he imposed an imperial tax which drove the city to support Rudolph's enemies. Although it withstood two sieges by the Emperor in 1288, after the defeat at Schosshalde in 1289 it had to pay taxes and a penalty.
In 1298 [Bern](3499)ese forces won a victory at Oberwangen in Köniz against the County of Savoy and the Habsburg Austrian nobility. In 1300, the city acquired the four surrounding parishes of Bolligen, Vechigen, Stettlen and Muri, destroyed the threatening castles of Bremgarten and Belp and gave the Baron of Montenach [Bern](3499)ese citizenship. After the victory of Louis IV of Bavaria over the Habsburg Frederick the Fair in the battle of Mühldorf (Bavaria) in 1322, [Bern](3499) entered an alliance with the anti-Habsburg Swiss Forest Cantons in 1323.

Old Swiss Confederacy
[Bern](3499) joined the Old Swiss Confederation in 1353.

14th century
In 1310 Emperor Henry VII pledged Laupen Castle, Laupen and the surrounding lands as collateral for a loan. In 1324, [Bern](3499) acquired the pledged castle and lands. When the Emperor was unable to repay the loan, Laupen became the first bailiwick of [Bern](3499).
In 1322, the brothers Eberhard II of Neu-Kyburg and Hartmann II of Neu-Kyburg started fighting with each other over who would inherit the family's lands around Thun. The fighting led to the "fratricide at Thun Castle" where Eberhard killed his brother Hartmann. To avoid punishment by his Habsburg overlords, Eberhard fled to [Bern](3499). In the following year, he sold the town of Thun, its castle and the land surrounding Thun to [Bern](3499). [Bern](3499) then granted the land back to Eberhard as a fief. [Bern](3499)'s support of Eberhard, their resulting expansion into the Oberland and their alliance with the Forest Cantons brought the city into conflict with the Habsburgs during the 14th century. The Gümmenenkrieg in 1333 between [Bern](3499) and Fribourg over rights and influence in the Sense/Singine area ended without resolving anything.
In 1334, [Bern](3499) fought with the Barons of Weissenburg and occupied Wimmis and Unspunnen in the Oberland. [Bern](3499)'s victory allowed them to bring the Oberhasli region, its capital of Meiringen and Weissenburg under their control. [Bern](3499)'s continued expansion was at the expense of the feudal lords in the surrounding lands. In 1339 the Habsburgs, Kyburgs and Fribourg, marched against [Bern](3499) with 17,000 men and besieged the border town of Laupen. To raise the siege, [Bern](3499) raised a force of 6,000, consisting of [Bern](3499)ese, supported by the Forest Cantons, and other allies (Simmental, Weissenbur and Oberhasli). The allied [Bern](3499)ese forces were victorious at the Battle of Laupen and [Bern](3499) drew closer to the Swiss Forest Cantons. It entered into a permanent or eternal alliance with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden in 1353. This date is usually considered the date of [Bern](3499)'s entrance into the Swiss Confederation; however, the alliance only indirectly tied [Bern](3499) to Zürich and Lucerne.
In 1358 the cash-strapped Count Peter II of Aarberg pawned the County of Aarberg to [Bern](3499). However, in 1367 he sold it, without repaying [Bern](3499), to his cousin Rudolf IV of Nidau. After Rudolf's death (1375) [Bern](3499) acquired clear right to the Aarberg lands from the other heirs.
Throughout the 14th century, [Bern](3499) entered into alliances and treaties with many of its neighbors, including members of the Swiss Confederation. [Bern](3499) entered into a series of agreements with Biel/Bienne, which led to a conflict with Biel's ruler, Jean de Vienne, the Prince-Bishop of [Basel](1372), in 1367–68. The bishop marched south and destroyed Biel along with a number of towns in the southern Jura Mountains. During the Gugler war in 1375, there were several battles between [Bern](3499)ese troops and English mercenaries under Enguerrand de Coucy.
By the 1370s, the Kyburgs (which still held Thun as a fief for [Bern](3499)) were deeply in debt to [Bern](3499). On 11 November 1382, Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg made an unsuccessful raid on Solothurn. The ensuing conflict with the Old Swiss Confederacy (known as the Burgdorferkrieg or Kyburgerkrieg) allowed [Bern](3499) to move against the Habsburgs in Aargau. After the [Bern](3499)ese laid siege to Burgdorf, Neu-Kyburg was forced to concede an unfavourable peace. [Bern](3499) bought Thun and Burgdorf, the most important cities of Neu-Kyburg, and their remaining towns passed to [Bern](3499) and Solothurn by 1408. The last of the Neu-Kyburgs, Berchtold, died destitute in [Bern](3499) in 1417.
In 1386, the Austrians under Leopold of Habsburg invaded eastern Switzerland. When they besieged the city of Sempach, troops from Zürich, Lucerne and the Forest Cantons marched out and defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Sempach. While [Bern](3499) was not involved at Sempach they took advantage of the Austrian weakness to march into the Oberland in 1386, followed by the Seeland (the region south of the Jura Mountains containing the Morat (Murten), Neuchâtel and Bienne (Biel) lakes) in 1388 and the Aargau in 1389. In the peace agreement of 1389 [Bern](3499) got Unterseen and the Upper Simme valley (Simmental) from the Habsburgs. In the same year, Fribourg accepted [Bern](3499)s acquisition of the Iselgaus, i.e. the area between Lake Biel and the Seeland. Over the next several decades [Bern](3499) continued to expand to the detriment of the Habsburgs and Fribourg. They acquired the following towns: 1391 Simmenegg, 1399 Signau, 1400 Frutigen, 1407 Wangen, 1408 Trachselwald and Huttwil, 1412 Oltigen and in 1413 (together with Solothurn) Bipp and Bechburg.

15th century
By 1400, [Bern](3499) controlled the entire [Bern](3499)ese Oberland. Under their control, the five valleys of the Oberland enjoyed extensive rights and far-reaching autonomy in the Bäuerten (farming cooperative municipalities) and Talverbänden (rural alpine communities). However, throughout the Late Middle Ages, the Oberland, as a whole or in part, revolted several times against [Bern](3499)ese authority. The Evil League (Böser Bund) in 1445 fought against [Bern](3499)ese military service and taxes following the Old Zürich War, in 1528 the Oberland rose up in resistance to the Protestant Reformation and in 1641 Thun revolted.
In the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland during the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century Interlaken Monastery grew to become the largest landholder in the region. The Monastery controlled the towns of Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen and numerous farms along Lake Brienz. However, in 1350 a period of crises and conflicts led to a decline in the number of monks and nuns and increasing debt. In 1348, the people of Grindelwald and Wilderswil joined a mutual defense league with Unterwalden. [Bern](3499) responded with a military expedition to the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland, which ended in defeat for Unterwalden and its allies. By 1472, [Bern](3499) was the patron of the Monastery. During the Protestant Reformation, the Monastery was secularized in 1528. The canons received a financial settlement and the properties were now managed by a [Bern](3499)ese bailiff. The tenants of the Monastery who had expected the abolition of all owed debts, responded by rioting, which was suppressed by [Bern](3499).

The lands around the northern shore of Lake Geneva and between Lake Neuchâtel were the next area into which [Bern](3499) expanded. The region had originally been part of the Carolingian Empire. Then, in 1032 the Zähringens of Germany defeated the [Burgundians](4587), who were then replaced by the counts of Savoy in 1218. Under the counts of Savoy the area was given political unity, and established as the Barony of Vaud. However, as the power of the Savoys declined at the beginning of the 15th century the land was occupied by troops from [Bern](3499). By 1536 the area was completely annexed. Reformation was started by co-workers of John Calvin, including Viret, who engaged in a famous debate at the cathedral of [Lausanne](3913); but it was only decisively implemented when [Bern](3499) put its full force behind it. Vaud was another French-speaking region in the mostly German-speaking canton, which caused several uprisings.
Both Château-d'Œx and Saanen were part of the county of Gruyère. Both districts had quite a bit of independence and often entered into treaties against the will and best interests of the Counts. In 1340 the Saanen valley concluded a peace treaty with the Simmental, which provided for arbitration in disputes. They entered into another treaty in 1393 with the Valais. In 1401, Count Rudolph of Gruyère entered into a treaty with [Bern](3499) which included Saanen. Two years later Saanen and Château-d'Œx negotiated their own alliances with [Bern](3499). Due to the [Bern](3499)ese alliance, Saanen sent troops, under their own banner, to support the [Bern](3499)ese invasions of Aargau in 1415 and Valais in 1418. The military losses and taxes following the Old Zürich War led Saanen to support the Evil League (Böser Bund) in 1445 against [Bern](3499).

In 1475, during the Burgundian Wars, the mountain regions of Saanen and Pays-d'Enhaut, who were allied with [Bern](3499), attacked and burned the tower of Aigle Castle. They then gave Aigle town and the surrounding district to [Bern](3499) in exchange for not having to pay one-third of their income to [Bern](3499). In the treaty of Fribourg from 1476, Fribourg received rights over the Aigle district, which they gave up to [Bern](3499) in 1483. [Bern](3499) rebuilt Aigle Castle in 1489 and made it the seat of the bailiwick of Aigle. Also in 1475, the Confederation attacked and captured Grandson Castle. In the next year, Charles the Bold retook the castle and executed the [Bern](3499)ese garrison. In 1476, at the Battle of Grandson, Charles' forces retreated and the [Bern](3499)ese retook Grandson. After Charles' defeat at the Battle of Murten, Grandson became a shared territory between [Bern](3499) and Fribourg. Each city appointed a vogt for five-year periods. Aigle and Grandson were the first French speaking regions in the Canton of [Bern](3499).
During the Burgundian War in 1475, Saanen, together with troops from Château-d'Œx and the Simmental captured the Savoy district of Aigle for [Bern](3499). Saanen and the surrounding district enjoyed a great deal of independence during the 16th century. However, in 1555 the last Count of Gruyère lost both districts to [Bern](3499) when his county went bankrupt. [Bern](3499) took over the entire Saanen valley in the following year and introduced the Protestant Reformation. They incorporated the Pays-d'Enhaut with Château-d'Œx into the new [Bern](3499)ese district of Saanen.

Acquired districts
The area of the canton of [Bern](3499) consists of lands acquired by the city of [Bern](3499) mostly between the 14th and the 16th century during the original Swiss Confederacy period, both by conquest and purchase.Acquired districts, with dates of acquisition, include:

Laupen (1324)
Oberhasli (1334)
Aarberg (1375)
Thun and Burgdorf (1384)
Unterseen and the Upper Simme valley (1386)
Frutigen and other towns in the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland (1400)
Aargau (1415)
Lower Simme valley (1439–1449)
Aigle and Grandson (1475)
Interlaken, with Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen and Brienz (1528, all the suppression of the Augustinian Canons at Interlaken Monastery)
Vaud (1536)
Saanen or Gessenay (1555)
the Pays d'En-Haut including Château-d'Œx (1555)
Köniz (1729).

Social changes in Early Modern [Bern](3499)
In the Middle Ages, upwards mobility and access to public offices was relatively easy for successful traders and craftsmen, but [Bern](3499)ese society became ever more stratified and aristocratic as the power and wealth of the city grew.
By the 17th century in the Early Modern period, citizenship had become an inherited prerogative, all political bodies elected one another and officials were elected for life. In effect, public offices were now the exclusive prerogative of the gnädige Herren, the "merciful lords", as the small number of noble families now ruling [Bern](3499) came to be called. In 1605 there were 152 families that were qualified to rule, by 1691 that number was only 104, while towards the end of the 18th century there were only 69 such families. Meanwhile, the land ruled by the town was extending over more and more territory, so that finally it governed 52 bailiwicks. These offices became very lucrative as the [Bern](3499)ese territories grew. Patrician Landvögte, sheriffs, ruled the politically powerless countryside, often using armed force to put down peasant revolts.
In Vaud the [Bern](3499)ese occupation was not popular amongst the population. In 1723, Major Abraham Davel led a revolt against [Bern](3499), in protest at what he saw as the denial of political rights of the French-speaking Vaudois by the German-speaking [Bern](3499)ese, and was subsequently beheaded.

Napoleonic period
Inspired by the French Revolution, the Vaudois drove out the [Bern](3499)ese governor in 1798 and declared the Lemanic Republic. Vaud nationalists like Frédéric-César de La Harpe had called for French intervention in liberating the area and French Revolutionary troops moved in, taking over the whole of Switzerland itself in the process and setting up the Helvetic Republic.
In 1798, with the establishment of the Helvetic Republic, [Bern](3499) was divided, the canton of Oberland with Thun as its capital and the canton of Léman with [Lausanne](3913) as its capital were detached from what was left of the Canton of [Bern](3499).
Within the new canton of Oberland, historic borders and traditional rights were not considered. As there had been no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order. The situation in the canton of Léman was quite different. The French-speaking Vaudois had never felt like part of the German-speaking Canton of [Bern](3499). When they joined the Swiss Confederation in 1803, it was as the Canton of Vaud.
Under the Helvetic Republic, Pays-d'Enhaut with Château-d'Œx became part of the Canton of Léman while Saanen and the rest of the district became part of the Canton of Oberland. When the Helvetic Republic collapsed in 1803, Saanen and its district became a district in the new Canton of [Bern](3499) while Château-d'Oex and its district joined Vaud.
The 1801 Malmaison Constitution proposed reuniting the Oberland with [Bern](3499), but it was not until the Act of Mediation, two years later, with the abolition of the Helvetic Republic and the partial restoration of the ancien régime, that the two cantons were reunited.
Between 1803 and 1814 [Bern](3499) was one of the six directorial cantons of the Napoleonic Swiss Confederation.

Modern history
With the post−Napoleonic Restoration of 1815, [Bern](3499) acquired the [Bern](3499)ese Jura with Biel/Bienne from the bishopric of [Basel](1372), while the canton of Léman became the canton of Vaud and remained separate from [Bern](3499).
[Bern](3499) still remained the largest canton of the confederacy from 1815 to 1979, when parts of the [Bern](3499)ese Jura broke away to form the canton of Jura. In 1994 the Laufen District was transferred to the canton of [Basel](1372)-Landschaft.

Geography
The canton of [Bern](3499) is mainly drained by the river Aare and its tributaries. The area of the canton is commonly divided into six regions. The most populated area is the [Bern](3499)ese Mittelland on the plateau north of the [Alps](1324), with the capital city of [Bern](3499). The northmost part of the canton is the [Bern](3499)ese Jura bordering the Canton of Jura. The [Bern](3499)ese Oberland is the mountainous region which lies in the south of the canton.
The area of the canton is 5,959 km2 (2,301 sq mi). Of this area, 6.9% is occupied with houses, businesses or roads. 42.6% of the canton is agricultural land, and 31.3% is forested. Less than 19.2% is considered non-productive, which includes glaciers, cliffs and lakes.

[Bern](3499)ese Mittelland
The [Bern](3499)ese Mittelland ([Bern](3499)ese Midlands) is made up of the valley of the rivers Aare, the (Grosse) Emme, some of the foothills of the [Bern](3499)ese [Alps](1324), as well as the plain around the capital [Bern](3499), and has many small farms and hilly forested regions with small to mid-sized towns scattered throughout. It is perhaps best known by foreigners and visitors for the Emmental. The classic Swiss cheese with holes Emmentaler comes from this region's forests and pastures, of hilly and low mountainous countryside in the 1,000 to 2,000 m (3,300 to 6,600 ft) range.

Three Lakes Region and [Bern](3499)ese Jura
In the north of the canton lies the predominantly French-speaking Three Lakes Region (Seeland), concentrated around Lake Biel, Neuchâtel, and Murten, which rises from the plain up to the northernmost Swiss mountain chain of the Jura. This area, culminating at the Chasseral, has more relaxed geography, although still some lower mountains and some waterfalls, and large lakes.

[Bern](3499)ese Oberland
The [Bern](3499)ese Oberland (German: [Bern](3499)er Oberland) constitute the north side of the [Bern](3499)ese [Alps](1324) and the west side of the Urner [Alps](1324) within the canton of [Bern](3499). The highest mountain in the [Bern](3499)ese [Alps](1324) is the Finsteraarhorn at 4,274 m (14,022 ft), but the best known mountains are Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau.
The well known hiking and ski resorts in the eastern Oberland are located around Interlaken and the Jungfrau, such as car-free Mürren and Wengen in the Lauterbrunnen valley, and Grindelwald. Further east, in the Haslital are the Aareschlucht and the town of Meiringen, famous for the fateful scene of Sherlock Holmes's 'death' at the hands of Professor Moriarty on the nearby Reichenbach Falls. In the Western [Bern](3499)ese Oberland there are many other resorts and small villages catering to visitors. These are accessed from the lake town of Thun, and the most notable of them are Kandersteg with the Oeschinensee and Adelboden. Further west is the Simmental with Lenk and Zweisimmen and the Saanenland with the famous resorts Gstaad and Saanen.
The whole area is very mountainous, with steep cliffs, many glaciers, and countless waterfalls. It is renowned for its scenic beauty and the charm of the small Swiss villages that dot the area. As a result of this, tourism is one of the main sources of income in the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland. The region also has an extensive train network as well as many cable cars and funiculars, with the highest train station in Europe at the Jungfraujoch and the longest gondola cableway in the world from Grindelwald to the Männlichen.
Mountains in the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland include:
