3499
Bern
[Bern](3499) (Swiss Standard German: bɛrn ), or [Bern](3499)e (French: bɛʁn ), is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to as the "federal city". With a population of about 133,000 (as of 2022), [Bern](3499) is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland, behind Zürich, Geneva, [Basel](1372) and Lausanne. The [Bern](3499) agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000.
[Bern](3499) is also the capital of the canton of [Bern](3499), the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons. The official language is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, [Bern](3499)ese German. In 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of [Bern](3499) became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is notably surrounded by the Aare, a major river of the Swiss Plateau.
Although fortified settlements were established since antiquity, the medieval city proper was founded by the Zähringer ruling family, probably in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen. [Bern](3499) was made a free imperial city in 1218 and, in 1353, it joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of its eight early cantons. Since then, [Bern](3499) became a large city-state and a prominent actor of Swiss history by pursuing a policy of sovereign territorial expansion. Since the 15th century, the city was progressively rebuilt and acquired its current characteristics. [Bern](3499) was made the Federal City in 1848. From about 5,000 inhabitants in the 15th century, the city passed the 100,000 mark in the 1920s.

Etymology
The etymology of the name "[Bern](3499)" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, the founder of the city of [Bern](3499), vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as [Bern](3499) in Middle High German. The city was sometimes referred to as [Bern](3499) im Üechtland to distinguish it from Verona. As a result of the finding of the [Bern](3499) zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna "cleft". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of [Bern](3499) from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s.

History
Early history
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today's city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of [Bern](3499), fortified since the second century BC (late La Tène period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The [Bern](3499) zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ("dwelling of Breno"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in Bümpliz, now a city district of [Bern](3499), was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.
The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de [Bern](3499)o, 1309), [Bern](3499) was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen.
In 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, [Bern](3499) was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.

Old Swiss Confederacy
In 1353, [Bern](3499) joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming the eighth canton of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.
[Bern](3499) invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the [Alps](1324). By the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of [Bern](3499) and the canton of Vaud.

The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the Käfigturm took over this role until 1345. It was succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located closer to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications – the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchments) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.
After a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses, and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.
During the 18th century, the city of [Bern](3499) was at one point the largest shareholder in the South Sea Company, a British joint-stock company which was involved in the [Atlantic slave trade](1583). From 1689 to 3 March 1798 in the town was printed, in French, the biweekly newspaper Gazette de [Bern](3499)e, which reflected the opinions of [Bern](3499), usually hostile to the politics of Pre-revolutionary France.

Modern history
[Bern](3499) was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the [Bern](3499)ese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the [Bern](3499)ese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.
On 28 November 1848, a majority of the new Swiss Federal Assembly deputies chose [Bern](3499) as the Federal City (seat of the government) of the newly created Swiss federal state, ahead of Zürich and Lucerne. [Bern](3499) was chosen as not to concentrate all the power in the economic powerhouse of Zürich, while Catholic and conservative Lucerne had been part of the Sonderbund during the war a year before. In addition, [Bern](3499) had a more central location and was supported by the French-speaking cantons due to proximity to them. However, the constitution doesn't define [Bern](3499) as official capital of Switzerland, but as the seat of government.
A number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in [Bern](3499), particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see [Bern](3499) International.
The city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s. Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000. As of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.
