Anglo-America
Anglo-America most often refers to a region in the [Americas](3978) in which English is the main language and British culture and the [British Empire](2056) have had significant historical, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural impact. This includes the [United States](1100), most of [Canada](1956), and some Caribbean countries. Anglo-America is distinct from Latin America, a region of the [Americas](3978) where Romance languages (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, and French) are prevalent. The adjective is commonly used, for instance, in the phrase "Anglo-American law", a concept roughly coterminous with Common Law.

Geographic region
While [Canada](1956) is one of the two principal Anglo-American countries, the province of Quebec and the region of Inuit Nunangat both have non-English speaking majorities, and for this reason they are excluded from Anglo-America. Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba are also not typically included in Anglo-America, despite their English-speaking majorities, because they are constituent countries or public bodies that form part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Ethnic groups
Economy
People from other parts of the world have immigrated to Anglo-America in search of a better quality of life, better employment, and an escape from famine, poverty, violence, and conflict. People from many different ethnic origins in Latin America and more remote places all over the world, including the less English-dominant parts of Oceania, continental [Europe](1994), [Asia](1914), and [Africa](1700), all live in Anglo-America contemporarily.
