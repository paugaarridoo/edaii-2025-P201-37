Cedar Rock State Park
Cedar Rock State Park is a state park in Buchanan County, Iowa, [United States](1100), preserving the [Frank Lloyd Wright](3201)-designed Lowell Walter Residence, also known as Cedar Rock.  The Usonian- style house was constructed on a bank of the Wapsipinicon River near Quasqueton, Iowa, in 1950. Following Lowell Walter's death in 1981, the home was donated to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and opened to the public.
The Walter House at Cedar Rock is one of [Frank Lloyd Wright](3201)'s most complete signature designs. Nearly everything at Cedar Rock bears the architect's imprint. Wright designed the furniture, chose the draperies, and even picked out the accessories.

Background
Cedar Rock is an important example of the Midwestern residential style created by Wright, characterized by its provisions for living simply and in harmony with nature. The Walter Residence is an example of a simplified style Wright called â€œUsonian". These designs were typically created as a single story with zoned areas for living. Wright accomplished this by designing this home in a "tadpole" shape.
