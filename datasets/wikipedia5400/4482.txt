4482
Bhutan
[Bhutan](4482), officially the Kingdom of [Bhutan](4482), is a landlocked country in South [Asia](1914) situated in the Eastern Himalayas between [China](2217) in the north and [India](2798) in the south, with the [India](2798)n state of Sikkim separating it from neighbouring Nepal. With a population of over 727,145 and a territory of 38,394 square kilometres (14,824 sq mi), [Bhutan](4482) ranks 133rd in land area and 160th in population. [Bhutan](4482) is a constitutional monarchy with a Druk Gyalpo (king) as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of government. The Je Khenpo is the head of the state religion, Vajrayana Buddhism.
The subalpine Himalayan mountains in the north rise from the country's lush subtropical plains in the south. In the [Bhutan](4482)ese Himalayas, there are peaks higher than 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) above sea level. Gangkhar Puensum is [Bhutan](4482)'s highest peak and is the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The wildlife of [Bhutan](4482) is notable for its diversity, including the Himalayan takin and golden langur. The capital and largest city is Thimphu, with close to 15% of the population.
[Bhutan](4482) and neighbouring Tibet experienced the spread of Buddhism, which originated in the [India](2798)n subcontinent during the lifetime of the Buddha. In the first millennium, the Vajrayana school of Buddhism spread to [Bhutan](4482) from the southern Pala Empire of Bengal. During the 16th century, Ngawang Namgyal unified the valleys of [Bhutan](4482) into a single state. Namgyal defeated three Tibetan invasions, subjugated rival religious schools, codified the Tsa Yig legal system, and established a government of theocratic and civil administrators. Namgyal became the first Zhabdrung Rinpoche and his successors acted as the spiritual leaders of [Bhutan](4482), like the Dalai Lama in Tibet. During the 17th century, [Bhutan](4482) controlled large parts of northeast [India](2798), Sikkim and Nepal; it also wielded significant influence in Cooch Behar State. [Bhutan](4482) ceded the Bengal Duars to British [India](2798) during the Duar War in the 19th century. The Wangchuck dynasty emerged as the monarchy and pursued closer ties with Britain in the subcontinent. In 1910, a treaty guaranteed British advice in foreign policy in exchange for internal autonomy in [Bhutan](4482). The arrangement continued under a new treaty with [India](2798) in 1949 (signed at Darjeeling) in which both countries recognised each other's sovereignty. [Bhutan](4482) joined the United Nations in 1971. It has since expanded relations with 55 countries. While dependent on the [India](2798)n military, [Bhutan](4482) maintains its own military units.
The 2008 Constitution established a parliamentary government with an elected National Assembly and a National Council. [Bhutan](4482) is a founding member of the South [Asia](1914)n Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). In 2020, [Bhutan](4482) ranked third in South [Asia](1914) after Sri Lanka and the Maldives in the Human Development Index, and 21st on the Global Peace Index as the most peaceful country in South [Asia](1914) as of 2024, as well as the only South [Asia](1914)n country in the list's first quartile. [Bhutan](4482) is also a member of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, the Non-Aligned Movement, BIMSTEC, the IMF, the World Bank, UNESCO and the World Health Organization (WHO). [Bhutan](4482) ranked first in SAARC in economic freedom, ease of doing business, peace and lack of corruption in 2016. [Bhutan](4482) has one of the largest water reserves for hydropower in the world. Melting glaciers caused by climate change are a growing concern in [Bhutan](4482).

Etymology
The precise etymology of "[Bhutan](4482)" is unknown, although it is likely to derive from the Tibetan endonym "Böd" for Tibet. Traditionally, it is taken to be a transcription of the Sanskrit Bhoṭa-anta (भोट-अन्त) "end of Tibet", a reference to [Bhutan](4482)'s position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture.
Since the 17th century, [Bhutan](4482)'s official name has been Druk yul (literally, "country of the Drukpa Lineage" or "the Land of the Thunder Dragon," a reference to the country's dominant Buddhist sect); "[Bhutan](4482)" appears only in English-language official correspondence. The terms for the Kings of [Bhutan](4482), Druk Gyalpo ("Dragon King"), and the [Bhutan](4482)ese endonym Drukpa, "Dragon people," are similarly derived.
Names similar to [Bhutan](4482)—including Bohtan, Buhtan, Bottanthis, Bottan and Bottanter—began to appear in Europe around the 1580s. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's 1676 Six Voyages is the first to record the name Boutan. However, these names seem to have referred not to modern [Bhutan](4482) but to the Kingdom of Tibet. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into the Scottish explorer George Bogle's 1774 expedition. Realising the differences between the two regions, cultures, and states, his final report to the East [India](2798) Company formally proposed calling the Druk Desi's kingdom "Boutan" and the Panchen Lama's kingdom "Tibet". The EIC's surveyor general James Rennell first anglicised the French name as "Bootan," and then popularised the distinction between it and Greater Tibet.
The first time a separate Kingdom of [Bhutan](4482) appeared on a western map, it did so under its local name "Broukpa". Others include Lho Mon ("Dark Southland"), Lho Tsendenjong ("Southland of the Cypress"), Lhomen Khazhi ("Southland of the Four Approaches") and Lho Menjong ("Southland of the Herbs").

History
Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that [Bhutan](4482) was inhabited as early as 2000 BC, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorised that the state of Lhomon (lit. 'southern darkness'), or Monyul ("Dark Land", a reference to the Monpa, an ethnic group in [Bhutan](4482) and [Arunachal Pradesh](2921), [India](2798)), may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600. The names Lhomon Tsendenjong (Sandalwood Country) and Lhomon Khashi, or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient [Bhutan](4482)ese and Tibetan chronicles.

Buddhism was first introduced to [Bhutan](4482) in the 7th century AD. The Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo (reigned 627–649), a Buddhist convert, extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and [Bhutan](4482). He ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, Bumthang in central [Bhutan](4482) and Kyichu (near Paro) in the Paro Valley. Buddhism was propagated in earnest in 746 under King Sindhu Rāja (also Künjom; Sendha Gyab; Chakhar Gyalpo), an exiled [India](2798)n king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace.: 35 : 13 

Much of early [Bhutan](4482)ese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital, Punakha, in 1827. By the 10th century, [Bhutan](4482)'s religious history had a significant impact on its political development. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronized by the various Mongol warlords.
[Bhutan](4482) may have been influenced by the Yuan dynasty with which it shares various cultural and religious similarities.
After the decline of the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa Lineage by the 16th century.

Locally, [Bhutan](4482) has been known by many names. The earliest Western record of [Bhutan](4482), the 1627 Relação of the Portuguese Jesuits Estêvão Cacella and João Cabral, records its name variously as Cambirasi (among the Koch Biharis), Potente, and Mon (an endonym for southern Tibet). Until the early 17th century, [Bhutan](4482) existed as a patchwork of minor warring fiefdoms, when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader Ngawang Namgyal, who had fled religious persecution in Tibet. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable dzongs or fortresses, and promulgated the Tsa Yig, a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralised control. Many such dzong still exist and are active centres of religion and district administration. Portuguese Jesuits Estêvão Cacella and João Cabral were the first recorded Europeans to visit [Bhutan](4482) in 1627, on their way to Tibet. They met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the Chagri Monastery reporting on his travels. This is a rare extant report of the Zhabdrung.
When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, his passing was kept secret for 54 years. After a period of consolidation, [Bhutan](4482) lapsed into internal conflict. In 1711, [Bhutan](4482) went to war against the Raja of the kingdom of Koch Bihar in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked [Bhutan](4482) in 1714.
In the 18th century, the [Bhutan](4482)ese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar. In 1772, the Maharaja of Koch Bihar appealed to the British East [India](2798) Company which assisted by ousting the [Bhutan](4482)ese and later attacking [Bhutan](4482) itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which [Bhutan](4482) agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the British were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the Duar War (1864–65), a confrontation to control of the Bengal Duars. After [Bhutan](4482) lost the war, the Treaty of Sinchula was signed between British [India](2798) and [Bhutan](4482). As part of the war reparations, the Duars were ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for a rent of ₹50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British [India](2798) and [Bhutan](4482).
During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of Paro and Tongsa led to civil war in [Bhutan](4482), eventually leading to the ascendancy of Ugyen Wangchuck, the penlop (governor) of Trongsa. From his power base in central [Bhutan](4482), Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882–85.
In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by Gongzim Ugyen Dorji. John Claude White, British Political Agent in [Bhutan](4482), took photographs of the ceremony. The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy. In 1910, [Bhutan](4482) signed the Treaty of Punakha, a subsidiary alliance that gave the British control of [Bhutan](4482)'s foreign affairs and meant that [Bhutan](4482) was treated as an [India](2798)n princely state. This had little real effect, given [Bhutan](4482)'s historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect [Bhutan](4482)'s traditional relations with Tibet. After the new Union of [India](2798) gained independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, [Bhutan](4482) became one of the first countries to recognise [India](2798)'s independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over [Bhutan](4482)'s foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent [India](2798).
In 1953, King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck established the country's legislature—a 130-member National Assembly—to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971, [Bhutan](4482) was admitted to the United Nations, having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.

[Bhutan](4482)'s sixth Five-Year Plan (1987–92) included a policy of 'one nation, one people' and introduced a code of traditional Drukpa dress and etiquette called Driglam Namzhag. The dress element of this code required all citizens to wear the gho (a knee-length robe for men) and the kira (an ankle-length dress for women). A central plank of the [Bhutan](4482)ese government's policy since the late 1960s has been to modernise the use of Dzongkha language. This began with abandoning the use of Hindi, a language that was adopted to help start formal secular education in the country, in 1964. As a result, at the beginning of the school year in March 1990, the teaching of Nepali language (which share similarities with Hindi) spoken by ethnic Lhotshampas in southern [Bhutan](4482) was discontinued and all Nepali curricular materials were discontinued from [Bhutan](4482)ese schools.
In 1988, [Bhutan](4482) conducted a census in southern [Bhutan](4482) to guard against illegal immigration, a constant issue in the south where borders with [India](2798) are porous. Each family was required to present census workers with a tax receipt from the year 1958—no earlier, no later—or with a certificate of origin, which had to be obtained from one's place of birth, to prove that they were indeed [Bhutan](4482)ese citizens. Previously issued citizenship cards were no longer accepted as proof of citizenship. Alarmed by these measures, many began to protest for civil and cultural rights and demanded a total change to be brought to the political system that existed since 1907. As protests and related violence swept across southern [Bhutan](4482), the government in turn increased its resistance. People present at protests were labeled "anti-national terrorists". After the demonstrations, the [Bhutan](4482)ese army and police began the task of identifying participants and supporters engaged in the violence against the state and people. They were arrested and held for months without trial. Soon the [Bhutan](4482)ese government arbitrarily reported that its census operations had detected the presence in southern [Bhutan](4482) of over 100,000 "illegal immigrants" although this number is often debated. The census operations, thus, were used as a tool for the identification, eviction and banishment of dissidents who were involved in the uprising against the state. Military and other security forces were deployed for forceful deportations of between 80,000 and 100,000 Lhotshampas and were accused of using widespread violence, torture, rape and killing. The evicted Lhotshampas became refugees in camps in southern Nepal. Since 2008, many Western countries, such as Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, [Australia](1659), and the [United States](1100), have allowed resettlement of the majority of the Lhotshampa refugees.

Political reform and modernization
[Bhutan](4482)'s political system has recently changed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck transferred most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowed for impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.
In 1999, the government lifted a ban on television and internet, making [Bhutan](4482) one of the last countries to introduce television. In his speech, the King said that television was a critical step to the modernisation of [Bhutan](4482) as well as a major contributor to the country's gross national happiness, but warned that the "misuse" of this new technology could erode traditional [Bhutan](4482)ese values.
A new constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008. On 9 December 2006, he announced that he would abdicate immediately. This was followed by the first national parliamentary elections in December 2007 and March 2008.
On 6 November 2008, 28-year-old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck was crowned king.
In July 2021 during the [COVID-19 pandemic](3556), [Bhutan](4482) became the first world-leading nation in its role of vaccinating 470,000 out of 770,000 people with a two-dose shot of [AstraZeneca](1654) vaccines.
On 13 December 2023, [Bhutan](4482) was officially delisted as a least developed country.

Geography
[Bhutan](4482) is on the southern slopes of the eastern Himalayas, landlocked between the Tibet Autonomous Region of [China](2217) to the north and the [India](2798)n states of Sikkim, West Bengal, Assam to the west and south, and the [India](2798)n state of [Arunachal Pradesh](2921) to the east. It lies between latitudes 26°N and 29°N, and longitudes 88°E and 93°E. The land consists mostly of steep and high mountains crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers that form deep valleys before draining into the [India](2798)n plains. In fact, 98.8% of [Bhutan](4482) is covered by mountains, which makes it the most mountainous country in the world. Elevation rises from 200 m (660 ft) in the southern foothills to more than 7,000 m (23,000 ft). This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to [Bhutan](4482)'s outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.

[Bhutan](4482)'s northern region consists of an arc of Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over 7,000 m (23,000 ft) above sea level; the highest point is 7,570-metre (24,840 ft)-tall Gangkhar Puensum, which has the distinction of being the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The lowest point, at 98 m (322 ft), is in the valley of Drangme Chhu, where the river crosses the border with [India](2798). Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds.
The Black Mountains in [Bhutan](4482)'s central region form a watershed between two major river systems: the Mo Chhu and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 1,500 and 4,925 m (4,921 and 16,158 ft) above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. The forests of the central [Bhutan](4482) mountains consist of Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests in higher elevations and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests in lower elevations. The Woodlands of the central region provide most of [Bhutan](4482)'s forest production. The Torsa, Raidāk, Sankosh, and Manas are [Bhutan](4482)'s main rivers, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.
In the south, the Sivalik Hills are covered with dense Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests, alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars Plain, which is the eponymous gateway to strategic mountain passes (also known as dwars or dooars; literally, "doors" in Assamese, Bengali, Maithili, Bhojpuri, and Magahi languages). Most of the Duars is in [India](2798), but a 10 to 15 km (6.2 to 9.3 mi)-wide strip extends into [Bhutan](4482). The [Bhutan](4482) Duars is divided into two parts, the northern and southern Duars.
The northern Duars, which abut the Himalayan foothills, have rugged, sloping terrain and dry, porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars have moderately fertile soil, heavy savanna grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by melting snow or monsoon rains, empty into the Brahmaputra River in [India](2798). Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005.

	Landscape of [Bhutan](4482)

Climate
[Bhutan](4482)'s climate varies with elevation, from subtropical in the south to temperate in the highlands and polar-type climate with year-round snow in the north. [Bhutan](4482) experiences five distinct seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. Western [Bhutan](4482) has the heavier monsoon rains; southern [Bhutan](4482) has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern [Bhutan](4482) are temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters.

[Biodiversity](2966)
[Bhutan](4482) signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1995. It has subsequently produced a National [Biodiversity](2966) Strategy and Action Plan, with two revisions, the most recent of which was received by the convention on 4 February 2010.

Animals
[Bhutan](4482) has a rich primate life, with rare species such as the golden langur. A variant Assamese macaque has also been recorded, which is regarded by some authorities as a new species, Macaca munzala.
The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, hispid hare and the sloth bear live in the tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, grey langur, tiger, goral and serow are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit-bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the Himalayan black bear, red panda, squirrel, sambar, wild pig and barking deer. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the snow leopard, blue sheep, Himalayan marmot, Tibetan wolf, antelope, Himalayan musk deer and the [Bhutan](4482) takin, [Bhutan](4482)'s national animal. The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern [Bhutan](4482), although in small numbers.
More than 770 species of bird have been recorded in [Bhutan](4482). The globally endangered white-winged duck has been added recently in 2006 to [Bhutan](4482)'s bird list.
The 2010 BBC documentary Lost Land of the Tiger follows an expedition to [Bhutan](4482). The expedition is notable for claiming to obtain the first footage of tigers living at 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the high Himalayas. The BBC footage shows a female tiger lactating and scent-marking, followed a few days later by a male tiger responding, suggesting that the cats could be breeding at this elevation. Camera traps also recorded footage of other rarely seen forest creatures, including dhole (or [India](2798)n wild dog), [Asia](1914)n elephants, leopards and leopard cats.

Plants
In [Bhutan](4482) forest cover is around 71% of the total land area, equivalent to 2,725,080 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 2,506,720 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 2,704,260 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 20,820 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 15% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 41% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.
More than 5,400 species of plants are found in [Bhutan](4482), including Pedicularis cacuminidenta. Fungi form a key part of [Bhutan](4482)ese ecosystems, with mycorrhizal species providing forest trees with mineral nutrients necessary for growth, and with wood decay and litter decomposing species playing an important role in natural recycling.

Conservation
The Eastern Himalayas has been identified as a global biodiversity hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by WWF between 1995 and 1997.
According to the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature, [Bhutan](4482) is viewed as a model for proactive conservation initiatives. The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity. This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty per cent of the land area under forest cover, to designate more than 40% of its territory as national parks, reserves and other protected areas, and most recently to identify a further nine per cent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas. All of [Bhutan](4482)'s protected land is connected to one another through a vast network of biological corridors, allowing animals to migrate freely throughout the country. Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation's development strategy, the middle path. It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in [Bhutan](4482)'s overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law. The country's constitution mentions environmental standards in multiple sections.

Environmental issues
Although [Bhutan](4482)'s natural heritage is still largely intact, the government has said that it cannot be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead. Nearly 56.3% of all [Bhutan](4482)ese are involved with agriculture, forestry or conservation. The government aims to promote conservation as part of its plan to target Gross National Happiness. It currently has net negative greenhouse gas emissions because the small amount of pollution it creates is absorbed by the forests that cover most of the country. While the entire country collectively produces 2,200,000 metric tons (2,200,000 long tons; 2,400,000 short tons) of carbon dioxide a year, the immense forest covering 72% of the country acts as a carbon sink, absorbing more than four million tons of carbon dioxide every year. [Bhutan](4482) had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.85/10, ranking it 16th globally out of 172 countries.
[Bhutan](4482) has a number of progressive environmental policies that have caused the head of the UNFCCC to call it an "inspiration and role model for the world on how economies and different countries can address climate change while at the same time improving the life of the citizen." For example, electric cars have been pushed in the country and as of 2014 make up a tenth of all cars. Because the country gets most of its energy from hydroelectric power, it does not emit significant greenhouse gases for energy production.
In practice, the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment. Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, [Bhutan](4482) has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered alarm fences, watch towers, and search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away.
The huge market value of the Ophiocordyceps sinensis fungus crop collected from the wild has also resulted in unsustainable exploitation which is proving very difficult to regulate.
[Bhutan](4482) has enforced a plastic ban rule from 1 April 2019, where plastic bags were replaced by alternative bags made of jute and other biodegradable material.

Government and politics
[Bhutan](4482) is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary form of government. The reigning monarch is Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. The current Prime Minister of [Bhutan](4482) is Tshering Tobgay, leader of the People's Democratic Party. [Bhutan](4482)'s democratic transition in 2008 is seen as an evolution of its social contract with the monarchy since 1907. In 2019, [Bhutan](4482) was classified in the Democracy Index as a hybrid regime alongside regional neighbours Nepal and [Bangladesh](4467). Minorities have been increasingly represented in [Bhutan](4482)'s government since 2008, including in the cabinet, parliament, and local government.
The Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) is the head of state. The political system grants universal suffrage. It consists of the National Council, an upper house with 25 elected members; and the National Assembly with 47 elected lawmakers from political parties.
Executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers led by the Prime Minister. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. Judicial power is vested in the courts. The legal system originates from the semi-theocratic Tsa Yig code, and was influenced by English common law during the 20th century. The chief justice is the administrative head of the judiciary.

Political culture
The first general elections for the National Assembly were held on 24 March 2008. The chief contestants were the [Bhutan](4482) Peace and Prosperity Party (DPT) led by Jigme Thinley and the People's Democratic Party (PDP) led by Sangay Ngedup. The DPT won the elections, taking 45 out of 47 seats. Jigme Thinley served as Prime Minister from 2008 to 2013.
The People's Democratic Party came to power in the 2013 elections. It won 32 seats and 54.88% of the vote. PDP leader Tshering Tobgay served as Prime Minister from 2013 to 2018.
Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa won the largest number of seats in the 2018 National Assembly election, bringing Lotay Tshering to the premiership and Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa into the government for the first time.
Tshering Tobgay returned to power as Prime Minister after the 2024 election, with the PDP gaining 30 seats; he assumed office on 28 January 2024.

Foreign relations
In the early 20th century, [Bhutan](4482) became a de facto protectorate of the [British Empire](2056) under the Treaty of Punakha in 1910. British protection guarded [Bhutan](4482) from Tibet and Qing [China](2217). In the aftermath of the Chinese Communist Revolution, [Bhutan](4482) signed a friendship treaty with the newly independent Dominion of [India](2798) in 1949. Its concerns were exacerbated after the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of [China](2217).
Relations with Nepal remained strained due to [Bhutan](4482)ese refugees. [Bhutan](4482) joined the United Nations in 1971. It was the first country to recognise [Bangladesh](4467)'s independence in 1971. It became a founding member of the South [Asia](1914)n Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985. The country is a member of 150 international organisations, including the Bay of Bengal Initiative, BBIN, World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 77.
[Bhutan](4482) maintains strong economic, strategic, and military relations with [India](2798). In February 2007, the Indo-[Bhutan](4482) Friendship Treaty was substantially revised, clarifying [Bhutan](4482)'s full control of its foreign relations, as well as its independence and sovereignty. Whereas the Treaty of 1949, Article 2 stated: "The Government of [India](2798) undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of [Bhutan](4482). On its part the Government of [Bhutan](4482) agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of [India](2798) in regard to its external relations," the revised treaty now states "In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between [Bhutan](4482) and [India](2798), the Government of the Kingdom of [Bhutan](4482) and the Government of the Republic of [India](2798) shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other." The revised treaty also includes this preamble: "Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity", an element absent in the earlier version. By long-standing agreement, [India](2798)n and [Bhutan](4482)ese citizens may travel to each other's countries without a passport or visa, but must still have their national identity cards. [Bhutan](4482)ese citizens may also work in [India](2798) without legal restrictions.
[Bhutan](4482) does not have formal diplomatic ties with [China](2217), but exchanges of visits at various levels between them have significantly increased in recent times. The first bilateral agreement between [China](2217) and [Bhutan](4482) was signed in 1998 and [Bhutan](4482) has also set up honorary consulates in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

[Bhutan](4482)'s border with [China](2217) is not mutually demarcated in some areas because [China](2217) lays claims to those places. In 2021, after more than 35 years of border negotiations, [China](2217) signed a memorandum of understanding with [Bhutan](4482) to expedite those talks. Approximately 269 square kilometres (104 sq mi) remain under discussion between [China](2217) and [Bhutan](4482). On 13 November 2005, Chinese soldiers crossed into the disputed territories between [China](2217) and [Bhutan](4482) and began building roads and bridges. [Bhutan](4482)ese Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the [Bhutan](4482)ese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People's Republic of [China](2217) said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute, denying that the presence of soldiers in the area was an attempt to forcibly occupy it. An [India](2798)n intelligence officer said that a Chinese delegation in [Bhutan](4482) told the [Bhutan](4482)ese they were "overreacting". The [Bhutan](4482)ese newspaper Kuensel said that [China](2217) might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border.
[Bhutan](4482) has very warm relations with Japan, which provides significant development assistance. The [Bhutan](4482)ese royals were hosted by the Japanese imperial family during a state visit in 2011. Japan is also helping [Bhutan](4482) cope with glacial floods by developing an early warning system. [Bhutan](4482) enjoys strong political and diplomatic relations with [Bangladesh](4467). The [Bhutan](4482)ese king was the guest of honour during celebrations of the 40th anniversary of [Bangladesh](4467)'s independence. A 2014 joint statement by the prime ministers of both countries announced cooperation in areas of hydropower, river management and climate change mitigation. [Bangladesh](4467) and [Bhutan](4482) signed a preferential trade agreement in 2020 with provisions for free trade.
[Bhutan](4482) has diplomatic relations with 53 countries and the [European Union](1200) and has missions in [India](2798), [Bangladesh](4467), Thailand, Kuwait, and Belgium. It has two UN missions, one in New York and one in Geneva. Only [India](2798), [Bangladesh](4467), and Kuwait have residential embassies in [Bhutan](4482). Other countries maintain informal diplomatic contact via their embassies in New Delhi and Dhaka. [Bhutan](4482) maintains formal diplomatic relations with several [Asia](1914)n and European nations, Canada, and Brazil. Other countries, such as the [United States](1100) and the United Kingdom, have no formal diplomatic relations with [Bhutan](4482) but maintain informal contact through their respective embassies in New Delhi and with the [United States](1100) through [Bhutan](4482)'s permanent mission to the United Nations. The United Kingdom has an honorary consul resident in Thimphu. The latest country [Bhutan](4482) has established diplomatic relations with is Israel, on 12 December 2020.
[Bhutan](4482) opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262.

Military
The Royal [Bhutan](4482) Army is [Bhutan](4482)'s military service and is the weakest armed force in the world, in terms of Power Index, according to the Global Firepower survey. It includes the royal bodyguard and the Royal [Bhutan](4482) Police. Membership is voluntary and the minimum age for recruitment is 18.
The standing army numbers about 16,000 and is trained by the [India](2798)n Army. It has an annual budget of about US$13.7 million (1.8 per cent of GDP). As a landlocked country, [Bhutan](4482) has no navy. It also has no air force or army aviation corps. The Army relies on the Eastern Air Command of the [India](2798)n Air Force for air assistance.

Human rights
[Bhutan](4482) is ranked as "Partly Free" by Freedom House. [Bhutan](4482)'s parliament decriminalised homosexuality in 2020.
Women in [Bhutan](4482) tend to be less active in politics than men due to customs and aspects of [Bhutan](4482)'s culture that dictate a woman's role in the household. This leads to a limitation of their voices in government. [Bhutan](4482) has made steps toward gender equality by enrolling more girls in school as well as creating the "National Commission for Women and Children" (NCWC) in 2004. This programme was created to promote and protect women's and children's rights. [Bhutan](4482) also elected its first female Dzongda, equivalent to a District Attorney, in 2012, and its first female minister in 2013. Minister Dorji Choden, chair for the National Commission for Women and Children, believes that the aforementioned programme can be used to "promote women into more leadership roles" which can then lead women to take on more active roles in their society. Overall there has also been a gradual increase in women in power with a 68% increase in women representation from 2011 to 2016.

1990s ethnic cleansing
Starting in the 1980s, a part of [Bhutan](4482)'s minority population groups of Nepali speakers ("Lhotshampa"), in Southern [Bhutan](4482), fell victim to perceived political persecution by the [Bhutan](4482)ese government as part of what the Nepali-speaking population viewed as [Bhutan](4482)isation (termed One Nation, One People) policy which was aimed to nationalise the country. In 1977 followed by in 1985, [Bhutan](4482)'s government enacted legislations which impacted the Lhotshampa ethnic minority. The review of the national citizenship criteria and provisions for denationalisation of illegally present population in the country ensued. The government enforced uniformity in dress, culture, tradition, language and literature to create a national identity which was aligned with the majority Drukpa culture of the country. The Lhotshampas started demonstrations in protest of such discriminatory laws, voicing for a change to be brought to the existing political system toward a preferred multi-party democracy and to gain political autonomy for the Nepali Ethnic minority, most probably incited by the similar political uprising against the established monarchy in the neighbouring country of Nepal. These demonstrations turned into violence when some ethnic Nepalese representatives were attacked by the government officials (armed forces) when schools in the southern districts were burned by the demonstrators. Consequently, [Bhutan](4482)ese armed forces were mobilised; the members of [Bhutan](4482)ese police and army forces allegedly imprisoned some Nepali descendant ethnic minority who were suspected to be politically active in these demonstrations, under a command of then king Jigme Singye Wangchuck and home minister Dago Tshering to keep peace and open a line of communication. [Bhutan](4482) Armed forces were alleged to have targeted the Nepali ethnic southerners by burning down the houses, livestocks, and forced hundreds and thousands to be expelled from the country with their property being confiscated where no compensation were reported to be granted to anyone, however, claims to these were neither proved nor documented.
This escalated up until the early 1990s, and was followed by the forceful expulsion of Nepali ethnic minority citizens from the southern part of [Bhutan](4482). The main purpose of this was the fear that revolt mirrored images of the Gorkhaland movement stirring up in the neighbouring state of West Bengal, and fueled fears of a fate similar to the Kingdom of Sikkim where the immigrant Nepalis population had overwhelmed the small native population of the kingdom, leading to its demise as an independent nation. The [Bhutan](4482)ese security forces were accused of human rights violations including torture and rape of political demonstrators, and some Lhotshampas were accused of staging a violent revolt against the state. According to the UNHCR, an estimate of 107,000 [Bhutan](4482)ese refugees living in seven camps in eastern Nepal have been documented as of 2008. After many years in refugee camps, many inhabitants moved to other host nations such as Canada, Norway, the UK, [Australia](1659), and the US as refugees. The US admitted 60,773 refugees from fiscal years 2008 to 2012.
The Nepalese government refused to assimilate the [Bhutan](4482)ese refugees (Lhotshampas) and did not allow a legal path to citizenship, so they were left stateless. Careful scrutiny has been used to review the status of the refugee's relatives in the country, and citizenship identity cards and voting rights for these reviewed people are restricted. [Bhutan](4482) does not recognise political parties associated with these refugees and see them as a threat to the well-being of the country. Human rights groups' rhetoric that the government interfered with individual rights by requiring all citizens, including ethnic minority members, to wear the traditional dress of the ethnic majority in public places was used as a political tool for the demonstrations. The [Bhutan](4482)ese government since then enforced the law of national attire to be worn in Buddhist religious buildings, government offices, schools, official functions, and public ceremonies aimed toward preserving and promoting the national identity of [Bhutan](4482).

The kingdom has been accused of banning religious proselytising, which critics deem as a violation of freedom of religion and a policy of ethnic cleansing. Starting in the 1980s, [Bhutan](4482) adopted a policy of "One Nation One People" to create a unified sense of national identity. This was interpreted as cultural (in language, dress and religion) and political dominance of the majority Drukpa people by the Nepali-speaking people. Inspired by the Gorkhaland Movement and fuelled by a sense of injustice, some Lhotshampas began organising demonstrations against the [Bhutan](4482)ese state. Furthermore, the removal of Nepali language in school curriculum to adopt a more centralised language in Dzongkha coupled with the denial of citizenship to those who were not able to prove officially issued land holding title prior to 1950 was perceived as specifically targeting Lhotshampa population estimated to be one-third of the population at the time. This resulted in widespread unrest and political demonstrations. In response to this threat, in 1988, the [Bhutan](4482)ese authorities carried out a special census in southern [Bhutan](4482) to review the status of legal residents from illegal immigrants. This region with high Lhotshampa population had to be legally verified, and the following census led to the deportation these Lhotshampas, estimated to be one-sixth of the total population at the time. People who had been granted citizenship by the [Bhutan](4482)ese 1958 Nationality Law were also stripped of their citizenship. The state intervened after violence was instigated by some Nepali-speaking citizens attacking government officials and burning public buildings. Members of [Bhutan](4482)ese police and army were accused of burning Lhotshampa houses, land confiscation and other widespread human rights abuses including arrest, torture and rape of Lhotshampas involved in political protests and violence. Following forcible deportation from [Bhutan](4482), Lhotshampas spent almost two decades in refugee camps in Nepal and were resettled in various western countries such as the [United States](1100) between 2007 and 2012.

Political divisions
[Bhutan](4482) is divided into twenty Dzongkhag (districts), administered by a body called the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. In certain thromdes (urban municipalities), a further municipal administration is directly subordinate to the Dzongkhag administration. In the vast majority of constituencies, rural gewog (village blocks) are administered by bodies called the Gewog Tshogde.
Thromdes (municipalities) elect Thrompons to lead administration, who in turn represent the Thromde in the Dzongkhag Tshogdu. Likewise, geog elect headmen called gups, vice-headmen called mangmis, who also sit on the Dzongkhag Tshogdu, as well as other members of the Gewog Tshogde. The basis of electoral constituencies in [Bhutan](4482) is the chiwog, a subdivision of gewogs delineated by the Election Commission.

Economy
[Bhutan](4482)'s currency is the ngultrum, whose value is fixed to the [India](2798)n rupee. The [India](2798)n rupee is also accepted as legal tender in the country.
Though [Bhutan](4482)'s economy is one of the world's smallest, it has grown rapidly in recent years, by eight per cent in 2005 and 14 per cent in 2006. In 2007, [Bhutan](4482) had the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, with an annual economic growth rate of 22.4 per cent. This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic Tala Hydroelectric Power Station. As of 2012, [Bhutan](4482)'s per capita income was US$2,420.
[Bhutan](4482)'s economy is based on agriculture, forestry, tourism and the sale of hydroelectric power to [India](2798). Agriculture provides the main livelihood for 55.4 per cent of the population. Agrarian practices consist largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars, are a small cottage industry. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.

This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that [Bhutan](4482) has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. [Bhutan](4482) has no railways, though [India](2798)n Railways plans to link southern [Bhutan](4482) to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005. [Bhutan](4482) and [India](2798) signed a 'free trade' accord in 2008, which additionally allowed [Bhutan](4482)ese imports and exports from third markets to transit [India](2798) without tariffs. [Bhutan](4482) had trade relations with the Tibet Autonomous Region of [China](2217) until 1960, when it closed its border with [China](2217) after an influx of refugees.
Access to biocapacity in [Bhutan](4482) is much higher than the world average. In 2016, [Bhutan](4482) had 5.0 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 [Bhutan](4482) used 4.5 global hectares of biocapacity per person—their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use less biocapacity than [Bhutan](4482) contains. As a result, [Bhutan](4482) is running a biocapacity reserve.
The industrial sector is currently in a nascent stage. Although most production comes from cottage industry, larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as cement, steel, and ferroalloy have been set up. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on contract labour from neighbouring [India](2798). Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (some yak, mostly cow) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations. Industries include cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and calcium carbide.
[Bhutan](4482) has seen recent growth in the technology sector, in areas such as green tech and consumer Internet/e-commerce. In May 2012, "Thimphu TechPark" was launched in the capital. It incubates startups via the "[Bhutan](4482) Innovation and Technology Centre" (BITC).

Incomes of over Nu 100,000 per year are taxed, but as [Bhutan](4482) is currently one of the world's least developed countries, very few wage and salary earners qualify. [Bhutan](4482)'s inflation rate was estimated at three per cent in 2003. [Bhutan](4482) has a gross domestic product of around US$5.855 billion (adjusted to purchasing power parity), making it the 158th-largest economy in the world. Per capita income (PPP) is around $7,641, ranked 144th. Government revenues total $407.1 million, though expenditures amount to $614 million. Twenty-five per cent of the budget expenditure, however, is financed by [India](2798)'s Ministry of External Affairs.
[Bhutan](4482)'s exports, principally electricity, cardamom, gypsum, timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and spices, total €128 million (2000 est.). Imports, however, amount to €164 million, leading to a trade deficit. Main items imported include fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery, vehicles, fabrics and rice. [Bhutan](4482)'s main export partner is [India](2798), accounting for 58.6 per cent of its export goods. Hong Kong (30.1 per cent) and [Bangladesh](4467) (7.3 per cent) are the other two top export partners. As its border with Tibet Autonomous Region is closed, trade between [Bhutan](4482) and [China](2217) is now almost non-existent. [Bhutan](4482)'s import partners include [India](2798) (74.5 per cent), Japan (7.4 per cent) and Sweden (3.2 per cent).

Agriculture
The share of the agricultural sector in GDP declined from approximately 55% in 1985 to 33% in 2003. In 2013 the government announced the aspiration that [Bhutan](4482) will become the first country in the world with 100 per cent organic farming. A decade later however this goal has proved elusive with just 1% of agricultural land having achieved organic status.
[Bhutan](4482)ese red rice is the country's most widely known agricultural export, enjoying a market in North America and Europe. [Bangladesh](4467) is the largest market of [Bhutan](4482)ese apples and oranges.
Fishing in [Bhutan](4482) is mainly centered on trout and carp.

Cryptocurrency
The Thunder Dragon Kingdom became one of a handful of countries to hold over USD 1 billion worth of Bitcoin as of November 15, 2024, with around 12,206 BTC. The Himalayan nation has been able to leverage its abundant hydroelectric resources to mine Bitcoin, with the chief executive officer of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), Ujjwal Deep Dahal, stating, "we hold assets in the form of Bitcoin and we started mining those assets in 2019 with our green hydropower." [Bhutan](4482) aims to expand its Bitcoin mining capacity to 600 megawatts by 2025 in partnership with Bitdeer, a leading Nasdaq-listed technology company. According to a World Bank report, [Bhutan](4482) has invested USD 539 million in cryptocurrency mining operations over the last two fiscal years, from July 2021 to June 2023.

Industry
The industrial sector accounts for 22% of the economy. The key manufacturing sectors in [Bhutan](4482) include production of ferroalloy, cement, metal poles, iron and nonalloy steel products, processed graphite, copper conductors, alcoholic and carbonated beverages, processed fruits, carpets, wood products and furniture. The production of ferrosilicon was pioneered by Damchae Dem, CEO of Pelden Group.

Mining
[Bhutan](4482) has deposits of numerous minerals. Commercial production includes coal, dolomite, gypsum, and limestone. The country has proven reserves of beryl, copper, graphite, lead, mica, pyrite, tin, tungsten, and zinc. However, the country's mineral deposits remain untapped, as it prefers to conserve the environment.

Energy
[Bhutan](4482)'s largest export is hydroelectricity. As of 2015, it generates about 2,000 MW of hydropower from dams in Himalayan river valleys. The country has a potential to generate 30,000 MW of hydropower. Power is supplied to various states in [India](2798). Future projects are being planned with [Bangladesh](4467). Hydropower has been the primary focus for the country's five-year plans. As of 2015, the Tala Hydroelectric Power Station is its largest power plant, with an installed capacity of 1,020 MW. It has received assistance from [India](2798), Austria and the [Asia](1914)n Development Bank in developing hydroelectric projects.
Besides hydropower, it is also endowed with significant renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and bioenergy. Technically viable solar energy generation capacity is around 12,000 MW and wind around 760 MW. More than 70% of its land is under forest cover, which is an immense source of bioenergy in the country.

Financial sector
There are five commercial banks in the country and the two largest banks are the Bank of [Bhutan](4482) and the [Bhutan](4482) National Bank which are based in Thimphu. Other commercial banks are [Bhutan](4482) Development Bank, T-Bank and Druk Punjab National Bank. The country's financial sector is also supported by other non-banking Financial Institutions. They are Royal Insurance Corporation of [Bhutan](4482) (RICB), National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF), and [Bhutan](4482) Insurance Limited (BIL). The central bank of the country is the Royal Monetary Authority of [Bhutan](4482) (RMA). The Royal Securities Exchange of [Bhutan](4482) is the main stock exchange.
The SAARC Development Fund is based in Thimphu.

Tourism
In 2014, [Bhutan](4482) received 133,480 foreign visitors. [Bhutan](4482) is a high-value destination. It imposes a daily sustainable development fee of US$100 a day on all nationals except [India](2798)ns, Maldivians, and [Bangladesh](4467)is. [India](2798)ns can apply for a permit to enter [Bhutan](4482) which costs 1,200 INR per day (about US$14 in 2024). The industry employs 21,000 people and accounts for 1.8% of GDP.
The country currently has no UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but it has eight declared tentative sites for UNESCO inclusion since 2012. These sites include: Ancient Ruin of Drukgyel Dzong, Bumdelling Wildlife Sanctuary, Dzongs: the centre of temporal and religious authorities (Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong), Jigme Dorji National Park (JDNP), Royal Manas National Park (RMNP), Sacred Sites associated with Phajo Drugom Zhigpo and his descendants, Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), and Tamzhing Monastery. [Bhutan](4482) also has numerous tourist sites that are not included in its UNESCO tentative list. [Bhutan](4482) has one element, the Mask dance of the drums from Drametse, registered in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

Transport
Air
Paro Airport is the only international airport in [Bhutan](4482). National carrier Drukair operates flights between Paro Airport and Bathpalathang Airport in Jakar (Bumthang Dzongkhag), central [Bhutan](4482), Gelephu Airport in Gelephu (Sarpang Dzongkhag) in the south and Yongphulla Airport in the east (Trashigang Dzongkhag)  on a weekly basis.

Road
The Lateral Road is [Bhutan](4482)'s primary east–west corridor, connecting the towns of Phuentsholing in the southwest to Trashigang in the east. Notable settlements that the Lateral Road runs through directly are Wangdue Phodrang and Trongsa. The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital Thimphu and other population centers such as Paro and Punakha. As with other roads in [Bhutan](4482), the Lateral Road presents serious safety concerns due to pavement conditions, sheer drops, hairpin turns, weather, and landslides.
Since 2014, road widening has been a priority across [Bhutan](4482), in particular for the north-east–west highway from Trashigang to Dochula. The widening project is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and will make road travel across the country substantially faster and more efficient. In addition, it is projected that the improved road conditions will encourage more tourism in the more inaccessible eastern region of [Bhutan](4482). Currently, the road conditions appear to be deterring tourists from visiting [Bhutan](4482) due to the increased instances of road blocks, landslides, and dust disruption caused by the widening project.

Rail
Although [Bhutan](4482) currently has no railways, it has entered into an agreement with [India](2798) to link southern [Bhutan](4482) to [India](2798)'s vast network by constructing an 18-kilometre-long (11 mi), 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm) broad gauge rail link between Hasimara in West Bengal and Gelephu in [Bhutan](4482). The construction of the railway via Satali, Bharna Bari and Dalsingpara by [India](2798)n Railways will be funded by [India](2798). [Bhutan](4482)'s nearest railway station is Hasimara. The planned Gelephu Green city will be linked by railway, connecting [India](2798)n state of Assam

Demographics
[Bhutan](4482) had a population of 777,486 people in 2021. [Bhutan](4482) has a median age of 24.8 years. There are 1,070 males to every 1,000 females. The literacy rate in [Bhutan](4482) is around 66%.

Ethnic groups
[Bhutan](4482)ese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchops, called the Western [Bhutan](4482)ese and Eastern [Bhutan](4482)ese respectively. Although the Sharchops are slightly larger in demographic size, the Ngalops dominate the political sphere, as the King and the political elite belong to this group. The Ngalops primarily consist of [Bhutan](4482)ese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet. Much the same could be said of the Sharchops, the largest group, who traditionally follow the Nyingmapa rather than the official Drukpa Kagyu form of Tibetan Buddhism. In modern times, with improved transportation infrastructure, there has been much intermarriage between these groups.
The Lhotshampa, meaning "southerner [Bhutan](4482)ese", are a heterogeneous group of mostly Nepalese ancestry who have sought political and cultural recognition including equality in right to abode, language, and dress. Unofficial estimates claimed that they constituted 45% of the population in the 1988 census. Starting in the 1980s, [Bhutan](4482) adopted a policy of "One Nation One People" to exert cultural (in language, dress and religion) and political dominance of the majority Drukpa people. The policy manifested in banning of teaching of Nepali language in schools and denial of citizenship to those who were not able to prove officially issued land holding title prior to 1950 specifically targeting ethnic Nepali-speaking minority groups ("Lhotshampa"), representing one-third of the population at the time. This resulted in widespread unrest and political demonstrations. In 1988, the [Bhutan](4482)ese authorities carried out a special census in southern [Bhutan](4482), region of high Lhotshampa population, resulting in mass denationalisation of Lhotshampas, followed by forcible deportation of 107,000 Lhotshampas, approximately one-sixth of the total population at the time. Those who had been granted citizenship by the 1958 Nationality Law were stripped of their citizenship. Members of [Bhutan](4482)ese police and army were involved in burning of Lhotshampa houses, land confiscation and other widespread human rights abuses including arrest, torture and rape of Lhotshampas involved in political protests. Following forcible deportation from [Bhutan](4482), Lhotshampas spent almost two decades in refugee camps in Nepal and were resettled in various western countries such as the [United States](1100) between 2007 and 2012.

Cities and towns
Thimphu, the largest city and capital of [Bhutan](4482).
Damphu, the administrative headquarters of Tsirang District.
Jakar, the administrative headquarters of Bumthang District and the place where Buddhism entered [Bhutan](4482).
Mongar, the eastern commercial hub of the country.
Paro, site of the international airport.
Phuentsholing, [Bhutan](4482)'s commercial hub.
Punakha, the old capital.
Samdrup Jongkhar, the southeastern town on the border with [India](2798).
Trashigang, administrative headquarters of Trashigang District, the most populous district in the country.
Trongsa, in central [Bhutan](4482), which has the largest and the most magnificent of all the dzongs in [Bhutan](4482).

Religion
It is estimated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the [Bhutan](4482)ese population follow Vajrayana Buddhism, which is also the state religion. 
Hinduism accounts for less than 12% of the population. The current legal framework in principle guarantees freedom of religion; proselytism, however, is forbidden by a royal government decision and by judicial interpretation of the Constitution.
Buddhism was introduced to [Bhutan](4482) in 746 AD, when Guru Padmasambhava visited Bumthang District. Tibetan king Songtsän Gampo (reigned 627–649), a convert to Buddhism, ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, at Bumthang in central [Bhutan](4482) and at Kyichu Lhakhang (near Paro) in the Paro Valley.

The national language is Dzongkha ([Bhutan](4482)ese), one of 53 languages in the Tibetan language family. The script, locally called Chhokey (literally, "Dharma language"), is identical to classical Tibetan. In [Bhutan](4482)'s education system, English is the medium of instruction, while Dzongkha is taught as the national language. Ethnologue lists 24 languages currently spoken in [Bhutan](4482), all of them in the Tibeto-Burman family, except Nepali, an Indo-Aryan language.
Until the 1980s, the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in southern [Bhutan](4482). With the adoption of the Driglam Namzhag ([Bhutan](4482)ese code of etiquette) and its expansion into the idea of strengthening the role of Dzongkha, Nepali was dropped from the curriculum. The languages of [Bhutan](4482) are still not well characterized, and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar. Before the 1980s, the Lhotshampa (Nepali-speaking community), mainly based in southern [Bhutan](4482), constituted approximately 30% of the population. However, after a purge of Lhotshampas from 1990 to 1992 this number might not accurately reflect the current population.
Dzongkha is partially intelligible with Sikkimese and spoken natively by 25% of the population. Tshangla, the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre-Tibetan language of [Bhutan](4482), is spoken by a greater number of people. It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto-Burman. Nepali speakers constituted some 40% of the population as of 2006. The larger minority languages are Dzala (11%), Limbu (10%), Kheng (8%), and Rai (8%). There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of [Bhutan](4482), so these numbers do not add up to 100%.

Health
[Bhutan](4482) has a life expectancy of 70.2 years (69.9 for males and 70.5 for females) according to the latest data for 2016 from the World Bank.
Basic healthcare in [Bhutan](4482) is free, as provided by the Constitution of [Bhutan](4482).

Education
Historically, education in [Bhutan](4482) was monastic, with secular school education for the general population introduced in the 1960s. The mountainous landscape poses barriers to integrated educational services.
Today, [Bhutan](4482) has two decentralised universities with eleven constituent colleges spread across the kingdom. These are the Royal University of [Bhutan](4482) and the Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of [Bhutan](4482), respectively. The first five-year plan provided for a central education authority—in the form of a director of education appointed in 1961—and an organised, modern school system with free and universal primary education.
Education programmes were given a boost in 1990, when the [Asia](1914)n Development Bank (see Glossary) granted a US$7.13 million loan for staff training and development, specialist services, equipment and furniture purchases, salaries and other recurrent costs, and facility rehabilitation and construction at Royal [Bhutan](4482) Polytechnic.
Since the beginning of modern education in [Bhutan](4482), teachers from [India](2798)—especially Kerala—have served in some of the most remote villages of [Bhutan](4482). Thus, 43 retired teachers who had served for the longest length of time were personally invited to Thimphu, [Bhutan](4482) during the Teachers' Day celebrations in 2018, where they were honoured and individually thanked by His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. To celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between [Bhutan](4482) and [India](2798), [Bhutan](4482)'s Education Minister, Jai Bir Rai, honoured 80 retired teachers who served in [Bhutan](4482) at a special ceremony organised at Kolkata, [India](2798), on 6 January 2019. Currently, there are 121 teachers from [India](2798) placed in schools across [Bhutan](4482).

Culture
[Bhutan](4482) has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century. One of the main attractions for tourists is the country's culture and traditions. [Bhutan](4482)ese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage. Hinduism is the second most dominant religion in [Bhutan](4482), being most prevalent in the southern regions. The government is increasingly making efforts to preserve and sustain the current culture and traditions of the country. Because of its largely unspoiled natural environment and cultural heritage, [Bhutan](4482) has been referred to as The Last Shangri-La.
While [Bhutan](4482)ese citizens are free to travel abroad, [Bhutan](4482) is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners. Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost, which is high for tourists on tighter budgets. Entry is free for citizens of [India](2798), [Bangladesh](4467), and the Maldives, but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a [Bhutan](4482)ese tour operator and pay around US$250 per day that they stay in the country, though this fee covers most travel, lodging and meal expenses. [Bhutan](4482) received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011, of which 25% were for meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions.
[Bhutan](4482) was the first nation in the world to ban tobacco. It was illegal to smoke in public or sell tobacco, according to Tobacco Control Act of [Bhutan](4482) 2010. Violators are fined the equivalent of $232—a month's salary in [Bhutan](4482). In 2021, this was reversed with the new Tobacco Control Act 2021 to allow for the import and sale of tobacco products to stamp out cross-border smuggling of tobacco products during the pandemic.

Dress
The national dress for [Bhutan](4482)ese men is the gho, a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the kera. Women wear an ankle-length dress, the kira, which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical brooches called the koma and tied at the waist with kera. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the "wonju", which is worn underneath the kira. A long-sleeved, jacket-like garment called the "toego" is worn over the kira. The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs, inside out. Social status and class determine the textures, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments.
Jewellery is commonly worn by women, especially during religious festivals ("tsechus") and public gatherings. To strengthen [Bhutan](4482)'s identity as an independent country, [Bhutan](4482)ese law requires all [Bhutan](4482)ese government employees to wear the national dress at work and all citizens to wear the national dress while visiting schools and other government offices, though many citizens, particularly adults, choose to wear the customary dress as formal attire.
Varicolored scarves, known as rachu for women and kabney for men, are important indicators of social standing, as [Bhutan](4482) has traditionally been a feudal society; in particular, red is the most common colour worn by women. The "Bura Maap" (Red Scarf) is one of highest honours a [Bhutan](4482)ese civilian can receive. It, as well as the title of Dasho, comes from the throne in recognition of an individual's outstanding service to the nation. On previous occasions, the King himself conferred Bura Maaps to outstanding individuals such as the Director General of Department Hydropower and Power System, Yeshi Wangdi, the Deputy Chairperson of National Council, Dasho Dr. Sonam Kinga, and former National Assembly Speaker, Dasho Ugyen Dorji.

Architecture
[Bhutan](4482)ese architecture remains distinctively traditional, employing rammed earth and wattle and daub construction methods, stone masonry, and intricate woodwork around windows and roofs. Traditional architecture uses no nails or iron bars in construction. Characteristic of the region is a type of castle fortress known as the dzong. Since ancient times, the dzongs have served as the religious and secular administrative centers for their respective districts. The University of Texas at El Paso in the [United States](1100) has adopted [Bhutan](4482)ese architecture for its buildings on campus, as have the nearby Hilton Garden Inn and other buildings in the city of El Paso.

Public holidays
[Bhutan](4482) has numerous public holidays, most of which coincide with traditional, seasonal, secular or religious festivals. They include the winter solstice (around 1 January, depending on the lunar calendar), Lunar New Year (February or March), the King's birthday and the anniversary of his coronation, the official end of monsoon season (22 September), National Day (17 December), and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations.

Media
Film industry
Music and dance
Dance dramas and masked dances such as the Cham dance are common traditional features at festivals, usually accompanied by traditional music. At these events, dancers depict heroes, demons, dæmons, death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people by wearing colourful wooden or composition face masks and stylised costumes. The dancers enjoy royal patronage, and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask-making.
The music of [Bhutan](4482) can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties; traditional music comprises religious and folk genres, the latter including zhungdra and boedra. The modern rigsar is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards, and dates back to the early 1990s; it shows the influence of [India](2798)n popular music, a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences.

Family structure
In [Bhutan](4482)ese families, inheritance generally passes matrilineally through the female rather than the male line. Daughters will inherit their parents' house. A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife's home. Love marriages are more common in urban areas, but the tradition of arranged marriages among acquainted families is still prevalent in most of the rural areas. Although uncommon, polygamy is accepted, often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it. The previous king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who abdicated in 2006, had four queens, all of whom are sisters. The current king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, wed Jetsun Pema, then 21, a commoner and daughter of a pilot, on 13 October 2011.

Cuisine
Rice (red rice), buckwheat, and increasingly maize, are the staples of [Bhutan](4482)ese cuisine. The local diet also includes pork, beef, yak meat, chicken, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chilies and cheese are prepared. Ema datshi, made very spicy with cheese and chilies, might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that [Bhutan](4482)ese have for it. Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include butter tea, black tea, locally brewed ara (rice wine), and beer.

Sports
[Bhutan](4482)'s national and most popular sport is archery. Competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from Olympic standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. Two targets are placed over 100 metres (330 ft) apart, and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional [Bhutan](4482)ese archery is a social event, and competitions are organised between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. Darts (khuru) is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10 cm (3.9 in) nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 to 20 metres (33 to 66 ft) away.
Another traditional sport is the Digor, which resembles the shot put and horseshoe throwing.
Another popular sport is football. In 2002, [Bhutan](4482)'s national football team played Montserrat, in what was billed as The Other Final; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the World Cup final, but at the time [Bhutan](4482) and Montserrat were the world's two lowest ranked teams. The match was held in Thimphu's Changlimithang National Stadium, and [Bhutan](4482) won 4–0. A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer. In 2015, [Bhutan](4482) won its first two FIFA World Cup Qualifying matches, beating Sri Lanka 1–0 in Sri Lanka and 2–1 in [Bhutan](4482). [Cricket](1466) has also gained popularity in [Bhutan](4482), particularly since the introduction of television channels from [India](2798). The [Bhutan](4482) national cricket team is one of the most successful affiliate nations in the region.

Women in the workforce
Women have begun to participate more in the work force and their participation is one of the highest in the region. However, the unemployment rates among women are still higher than those of men and women are in more unsecure work fields, such as agriculture. Most of the work that women do outside of the home is in family-based agriculture which is insecure and is one of the reasons why women are falling behind men when it comes to income. Women also, in general, work lower-quality jobs than men and only earn 75% of men's earnings.

Women in the household
Rooted deep in [Bhutan](4482) culture is the idea of selflessness and the women of [Bhutan](4482) take on this role in the context of the household. Nearly 1/4 of all women have reported experiencing some form of violence from their husband or partner. Some [Bhutan](4482)ese communities have what is referred to as matrilineal communities, where the eldest daughter receives the largest share of the land. This is due to the belief that she will stay and take care of her parents while the son will move out and work to get his own land and for his own family. Importantly, land ownership does not necessarily equate to economic benefits – despite the eldest daughter having control of the house, it is the husband that is in charge of making decisions. However, the younger generation has stepped away from this belief, in splitting the land evenly between the children instead of the eldest daughter inheriting the most land.

Women's health
Throughout [Bhutan](4482), there has been an improvement in reproductive health services that has led to a drastic drop in maternal mortality rate, dropping from 1,000 in 1990 to 180 in 2010. There has also been an increase in contraceptive use from less than 1/3 in 2003 to 2/3 in 2010.
