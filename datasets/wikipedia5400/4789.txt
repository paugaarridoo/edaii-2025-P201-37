4789
Council of Europe
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) (CoE; French: Conseil de l'[Europe](1994), CdE) is an international organisation with the goal of upholding human rights, democracy and the rule of law in [Europe](1994). Founded in 1949, it is [Europe](1994)'s oldest intergovernmental organisation, representing 46 member states, with a population of approximately 675 million as of 2023; it operates with an annual budget of approximately 500 million euros.
The organisation is distinct from the [Europe](1994)an Union (EU), although people sometimes confuse the two organisations – partly because the EU has adopted the original [Europe](1994)an flag, designed for the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in 1955, as well as the [Europe](1994)an anthem. No country has ever joined the EU without first belonging to the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is an official United Nations observer.
Unlike the EU, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) cannot make binding laws; however, the council has produced a number of international treaties, including the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights, ECHR) of 1953. Provisions from the convention are incorporated in domestic law in many participating countries. The best-known body of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights, which rules on alleged violations of the ECHR. 
The council's two statutory bodies are the Committee of Ministers, which comprises the foreign ministers of each member state, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) (PACE), which is composed of members of the national parliaments of each member state. The Commissioner for Human Rights is an institution within the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights within the member states. The secretary general presides over the secretariat of the organisation. Other major CoE bodies include the [Europe](1994)an Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) and the [Europe](1994)an Audiovisual Observatory.
The headquarters of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), as well as its Court of Human Rights, are situated in Strasbourg, France. The Council uses English and French as its two official languages. The Committee of Ministers, the PACE, and the Congress of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) also use German and Italian for some of their work.

History
Founding
In a speech in 1929, French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand floated the idea of an organisation which would gather [Europe](1994)an nations together in a "federal union" to resolve common problems. The United Kingdom's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill first publicly suggested the creation of a "[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)" in a BBC radio broadcast on 21 March 1943, while the Second World War was still raging. In his own words, he tried to "peer through the mists of the future to the end of the war", and think about how to rebuild and maintain peace on a shattered continent. Given that [Europe](1994) had been at the origin of two world wars, the creation of such a body would be, he suggested, "a stupendous business". He returned to the idea during a well-known speech at the University of Zurich on 19 September 1946, throwing the full weight of his considerable post-war prestige behind it.
Additionally, there were also many other statesmen and politicians across the continent, many of them members of the [Europe](1994)an Movement, who were quietly working towards the creation of the council. Some regarded it as a guarantee that the horrors of war – or the human rights violations of the Nazi regime – could never again be visited on the continent, others came to see it as a "club of democracies", built around a set of common values that could stand as a bulwark against totalitarian states belonging to the Eastern Bloc. Others again saw it as a nascent "[United States](1100) of [Europe](1994)", the resonant phrase that Churchill had reached for at Zurich in 1946.

The future structure of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) was discussed at the Congress of [Europe](1994), which brought together several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and members of civil society in The Hague, [Netherlands](2285), in 1948. Responding to the conclusions of the Congress of [Europe](1994), the Consultative Council of the Treaty of Brussels convened a Committee for the Study of [Europe](1994)an Unity, which met eight times from November 1948 to January 1949 to draw up the blueprint of a new broad-based [Europe](1994)an organisation.
There were two competing schools of thought: some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers (in which governments were represented) and a Consultative Assembly (in which parliaments were represented), the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [Europe](1994)an Communities, NATO and OSCE.
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) was signed into existence on 5 May 1949 by the Treaty of London, the organisation's founding Statute which set out the three basic values that should guide its work: democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It was signed in London on that day by ten states: [Belgium](197), [Denmark](1500), France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the [Netherlands](2285), Norway, [Sweden](1600) and the United Kingdom, though Turkey and Greece joined three months later. On 10 August 1949, 100 members of the council's Consultative Assembly, parliamentarians drawn from the twelve member nations, met in Strasbourg for its first plenary session, held over 18 sittings and lasting nearly a month. They debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from war, yet already facing a new East–West divide, launched the radical concept of a trans-national court to protect the basic human rights of every citizen, and took the first steps in a process that would eventually lead to the creation of an offshoot organisation, the [Europe](1994)an Union.
In August 1949, Paul-Henri Spaak resigned as [Belgium](197)'s foreign minister in order to be elected as the first president of the assembly. Behind the scenes, he too had been quietly working towards the creation of the council, and played a key role in steering its early work. However, in December 1951, after nearly three years in the role, Spaak resigned in disappointment after the Assembly rejected proposals for a "[Europe](1994)an political authority". Convinced that the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) was never going to be in a position to achieve his long-term goal of a unified [Europe](1994), he soon tried again in a new and more promising format, based this time on economic integration, becoming one of the founders of the [Europe](1994)an Union.

Early years
There was huge enthusiasm for the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in its early years, as its pioneers set about drafting what was to become the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights, a charter of individual rights which – it was hoped – no member government could ever again violate. They drew, in part, on the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed only a few months earlier in [Paris](2293). But crucially, where the Universal Declaration was essentially aspirational, the [Europe](1994)an Convention from the beginning featured an enforcement mechanism – an international Court – which was to adjudicate on alleged violations of its articles and to hold governments to account, a dramatic leap forward for international justice. Today, this is the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding on 46 [Europe](1994)an nations, the most far-reaching system of international justice anywhere in the world.
One of the council's first acts was to welcome West Germany into its fold on 2 May 1951, setting a pattern of post-war reconciliation that was to become a hallmark of the council, and beginning a long process of "enlargement" which was to see the organisation grow from its original ten founding member states to the 46 nations that make up the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) today. Iceland had already joined in 1950, followed in 1956 by [Austria](1585), Cyprus in 1961, Switzerland in 1963 and Malta in 1965.

Historic speeches at the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)
In 2018, an archive of all speeches made to the PACE by heads of state or government since the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)'s creation in 1949 appeared online, the fruit of a two-year project entitled "Voices of [Europe](1994)". At the time of its launch, the archive comprised 263 speeches delivered over a 70-year period by some 216 presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and religious leaders from 45 countries – though it continues to expand, as new speeches are added every few months.
Some very early speeches by individuals considered to be "founding figures" of the [Europe](1994)an institutions, even if they were not heads of state or government at the time, are also included (such as Sir Winston Churchill or Robert Schuman). Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list (such as King Juan Carlos I of Spain, King Albert II of [Belgium](197) and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg) as well as the speeches given by religious figures (such as Pope John Paul II, and Pope Francis) and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North [Africa](1700) (such as Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat, Hosni Mubarak, Léopold Sédar Senghor or King Hussein of Jordan).
The full text of the speeches is given in both English and French, regardless of the original language used. The archive is searchable by country, by name, and chronologically.

Aims and achievement
Article 1(a) of the Statute states that "The aim of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress." Membership is open to all [Europe](1994)an states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human rights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.
Whereas the member states of the [Europe](1994)an Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the [Europe](1994)an Commission and the [Europe](1994)an Parliament, [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties (international law) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for [Europe](1994)an cooperation and harmony, with the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) being the geographically wider circle. The [Europe](1994)an Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. "The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and the [Europe](1994)an Union: different roles, shared values." [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) conventions/treaties are also open for signature to non-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside [Europe](1994).
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)'s most famous achievement is the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights, which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the PACE, and followed on from the United Nations 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights' (UDHR). The Convention created the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest [Europe](1994)an court. It is to this court that [Europe](1994)ans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.
The various activities and achievements of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) can be found in detail on its official website. The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) works in the following areas:

Institutions
The institutions of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) are:

The Secretary General, who is elected for a term of five years by the PACE and heads the Secretariat of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, was elected Secretary General of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) on 29 September 2009. In June 2014, he became the first Secretary General to be re-elected, commencing his second term in office on 1 October 2014.
The Committee of Ministers, comprising the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of all 46 member states who are represented by their Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors accredited to the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). Committee of Ministers' presidencies are held in alphabetical order for six months following the English alphabet: Turkey 11/2010-05/2011, Ukraine 05/2011-11/2011, the United Kingdom 11/2011-05/2012, [Albania](1534) 05/2012-11/2012, [Andorra](1549) 11/2012-05/2013, [Armenia](1567) 05/2013-11/2013, [Austria](1585) 11/2013-05/2014, and so on.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) (PACE), which comprises national parliamentarians from all member states. Adopting resolutions and recommendations to governments, the Assembly holds a dialogue with its governmental counterpart, the Committee of Ministers, and is often regarded as the "motor" of the organisation. The national parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was rapporteur for the drafting of the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights. Dick Marty's reports on secret CIA detentions and rendition flights in [Europe](1994) became quite famous in 2006 and 2007. Other Assembly reports were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in [Europe](1994), highlighting the political and human rights situation in Chechnya, identifying who was responsible for disappeared persons in [Belarus](1683), chronicling threats to freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.
The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in this field are the [Europe](1994)an Charter of Local Self-Government of 1985 and the [Europe](1994)an Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.
The [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights, created under the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights of 1950, is composed of a judge from each member state elected for a single, non-renewable term of nine years by the PACE and is headed by the elected president of the court. The current president of the court is Guido Raimondi from Italy. Under the recent Protocol No. 14 to the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights, the Court's case processing was reformed and streamlined. Ratification of Protocol No. 14 was delayed by Russia for a number of years, but won support to be passed in January 2010.
The Commissioner for Human Rights is elected by the PACE for a non-renewable term of six years since the creation of this position in 1999. Since April 2024, this position has been held by Michael O'Flaherty from Ireland.
The Conference of INGOs. NGOs can participate in the INGOs Conference of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). Since the Resolution (2003)8 adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 19 November 2003, they are given a "participatory status".
The Joint Council on Youth of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789). The [Europe](1994)an Steering Committee (CDEJ) on Youth and the Advisory Council on Youth (CCJ) of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) form together the Joint Council on Youth (CMJ). The CDEJ brings together representatives of ministries or bodies responsible for youth matters from the 50 States Parties to the [Europe](1994)an Cultural Convention. The CDEJ fosters cooperation between governments in the youth sector and provides a framework for comparing national youth policies, exchanging best practices and drafting standard-setting texts. The Advisory Council on Youth comprises 30 representatives of non-governmental youth organisations and networks. It provides opinions and input from youth NGOs on all youth sector activities and ensures that young people are involved in the council's other activities.
Information Offices of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in many member states.

Partial Agreements
The CoE system also includes a number of semi-autonomous structures known as "Partial Agreements", some of which are also open to non-member states:

Summits
Occasionally the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) organizes summits of the heads of state and government of its member states. Four summits have been held to date with the fourth concluding on 17 May 2023.

Headquarters and buildings
The seat of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is in Strasbourg, France. First meetings were held in Strasbourg's University Palace in 1949, but the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) soon moved into its own buildings. The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)'s eight main buildings are situated in the Quartier européen, an area in the northeast of Strasbourg spread over the three districts of Le Wacken, La Robertsau and Quartier de l'Orangerie, where are also located the four buildings of the seat of the [Europe](1994)an Parliament in Strasbourg, the Arte headquarters and the seat of the International Institute of Human Rights.
Building in the area started in 1949 with the predecessor of the Palais de l'[Europe](1994), the House of [Europe](1994) (demolished in 1977), and came to a provisional end in 2007 with the opening of the New General Office Building, later named "Agora", in 2008. The Palais de l'[Europe](1994) (Palace of [Europe](1994)) and the [Art Nouveau](1339) Villa Schutzenberger (seat of the [Europe](1994)an Audiovisual Observatory) are in the Orangerie district, and the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights, the EDQM and the Agora Building are in the Robertsau district. The Agora building has been voted "best international business centre real estate project of 2007" on 13 March 2008, at the MIPIM 2008. The [Europe](1994)an Youth Centre is located in the Wacken district.
Besides its headquarters in Strasbourg, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is also present in other cities and countries. The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Development Bank has its seat in [Paris](2293), the North-South Centre of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is established in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Centre for Modern Languages is in Graz, [Austria](1585). There are [Europe](1994)an Youth Centres in [Budapest](4580), Hungary, and in Strasbourg. The [Europe](1994)an Wergeland Centre, a new Resource Centre on education for intercultural dialogue, human rights and democratic citizenship, operated in cooperation with the Norwegian Government, opened in Oslo, Norway, in February 2009.
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) has external offices all over the [Europe](1994)an continent and beyond. There are four 'Programme Offices', namely in Ankara, Podgorica, Skopje, and Venice. There are also '[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Offices' in Baku, Belgrade, Chisinau, Kyiv, [Paris](2293), Pristina, Sarajevo, Tbilisi, Tirana, and Yerevan. Bucharest has a [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Office on Cybercrime. There are also [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Offices in non-[Europe](1994)an capital cities like Rabat and Tunis.
Additionally, there are 4 "[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Liaison Offices", this includes:

[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Liaison Office in Brussels: The office is in charge of liaison with the [Europe](1994)an Union
[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Office in Geneva:  Permanent Delegation of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) to the United Nations Office and other international organisations in Geneva
[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Office in Vienna: The office is in charge of liaison with the OSCE, United Nations Office, and other international organisations in Vienna
[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Office in Warsaw: The office is in charge of liaison with other international organisations and institutions in Warsaw, in particular, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR)

Member states, observers, partners
Eligibility
There are two main criteria for membership: geographic (Article 4 of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Statute specifies that membership is open to any "[Europe](1994)an" State) and political (Article 3 of the Statute states applying for membership must accept democratic values—"Every member of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) must accept the principles of the rule of law and the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and collaborate sincerely and effectively in the realisation of the aim of the Council as specified in Chapter I").
Since "[Europe](1994)" is not defined in international law, the definition of "[Europe](1994)" has been a question that has recurred during the CoE's history. Turkey was admitted in 1950, although it is a transcontinental state that lies mostly in Asia, with a smaller portion in [Europe](1994). In 1994, the PACE adopted Recommendation 1247, which said that admission to the CoE should be "in principle open only to states whose national territory lies wholly or partly in [Europe](1994)"; later, however, the Assembly extended eligibility to apply and be admitted to [Armenia](1567), [Azerbaijan](1588), and Georgia.

Member states and observers
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) was founded on 5 May 1949 by [Belgium](197), [Denmark](1500), France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, [Netherlands](2285), Norway, [Sweden](1600) and the United Kingdom. Greece and Turkey joined three months later. Iceland, West Germany and Saar Protectorate joined the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) as associate members in 1950. West Germany became a full member in 1951, and the Saar withdrew its application after it joined West Germany following the 1955 Saar Statute referendum. Joining later were [Austria](1585) (1956), Cyprus (1961), Switzerland (1963), Malta (1965), and Portugal (1976). Spain joined in 1977, two years after the death of its dictator Francisco Franco and the [Spanish transition to democracy](3940). Next to join were Liechtenstein (1978), San Marino (1988) and [Finland](2238) (1989). After the fall of Communism with the Revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the following countries in [Europe](1994) joined: Hungary (1990), Poland (1991), [Bulgaria](4363) (1992), Estonia (1993), Lithuania (1993), Slovenia (1993), the [Czech Republic](1975) (1993), Slovakia (1993), Romania (1993), [Andorra](1549) (1994), Latvia (1995), Moldova (1995), [Albania](1534) (1995), Ukraine (1995), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1995) (later renamed North Macedonia), Russia (1996, expelled 2022), [Croatia](4797) (1996), Georgia (1999), [Armenia](1567) (2001), [Azerbaijan](1588) (2001), [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) (2002), Serbia and Montenegro (later Serbia) (2003) and Monaco (2004). The council now has 46 member states, with Montenegro (2007) being the latest to join.
Although most Council members are predominantly Christian in heritage, there are four Muslim-majority member states: [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), Turkey, [Albania](1534), and [Azerbaijan](1588).
The CoE has granted some countries a status that allows them to participate in CoE activities without being full members. There are three types of nonmember status: associate member, special guest and observer. Associate member status was created for former Axis states which had not yet regained their sovereignty since their defeat in the Second World War; as such, it is no longer used, although there have been proposals to reactivate it to permit enhanced participation by the current observer states. "Special guest" status was used as a transitional status for post-Soviet countries that wished to join the council after the fall of the Berlin Wall and is no longer commonly used. "Observer" status is for non-[Europe](1994)an nations who accept democracy, rule of law, and human rights, and wish to participate in Council initiatives. The [United States](1100) became an observer state in 1995. Currently, [Canada](1956), the Holy See, Japan, Mexico, and the [United States](1100) are observer states, while Israel is an observer to the PACE. Additionally Kosovo is a member of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Development Bank and a member of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)'s Venice Commission. The Assembly of Kosovo was invited to take part in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and its committees as an observer in 2016. Two representatives of local government in Kosovo participate in the work of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities as observers.

Withdrawal, suspension, and expulsion
The Statute of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) provides for the voluntary suspension, involuntary suspension, and exclusion of members. Article 8 of the Statute provides that any member who has "seriously violated" Article 3 may be suspended from its rights of representation, and that the Committee of Ministers may request that such a member withdraws from the Council under Article 7. (The Statute does not define the "serious violation" phrase. Under Article 8 of the Statute, if a member state fails to withdraw upon request, the Committee may terminate its membership, in consultation with the PACE.
The Council suspended Greece in 1967, after a military coup d'état, and the Greek junta withdrew from the CoE. Greece was readmitted to the council in 1974.

Suspension and exclusion of Russia
Russia became a member of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in 1996. In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, the Council stripped Russia of its voting rights in the PACE. In response, Russia began to boycott the Assembly in 2016, and beginning from 2017 ceased paying its annual membership dues of 32.6 million euros (US$37.1 million) to the Council placing the institution under financial strain.
Russia stated that its suspension by the council was unfair, and demanded the restoration of its voting rights. Russia had threatened to withdraw from the Council unless its voting rights were restored in time for the election of a new secretary general. [Europe](1994)an Council secretary-general Thorbjørn Jagland organized a special committee to find a compromise with Russia in early 2018, a move that was criticised by some as giving in to alleged Russian pressure by Council members and academic observers, especially if voting sanctions were lifted. In June 2019, an approximately two-thirds majority of the Council voted (on a 118–62 vote, with 10 abstentions) to restore Russia's voting rights in the council. Opponents of lifting the suspension included Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries, such as the Baltic states, who argued that readmission amounted to normalizing Russia's malign activity. Supporters of restoring Russia's council rights included France and Germany, which argued that a Russian withdrawal from the council would be harmful because it would deprive Russian citizens of their ability to initiate cases in the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights.
On 3 March 2022, after Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the council suspended Russia for violations of the council's statute and the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The suspension blocked Russia from participation in the council's ministerial council, the PACE, and the Council of the Baltic Sea States, but still left Russia obligated to follow the ECHR. On 15 March 2022, hours before the vote to expel the country, Russia initiated a voluntary withdrawal procedure from the council. The Russian delegation planned to deliver its formal withdrawal on 31 December 2022, and announced its intent to denounce the ECHR. However, on the same day, the council's Committee of Ministers decided Russia's membership in the council would be terminated immediately, and determined that Russia had been excluded from the Council instead under its exclusion mechanism rather than the withdrawal mechanism. After being excluded from the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), Russia's former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev endorsed restoring the death penalty in Russia.

Co-operation
Conventions: [Europe](1994)an Treaty Series
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) works mainly through international treaties, usually called conventions in its system. By drafting conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. The conventions are collected in the [Europe](1994)an Treaty Series.

Non-member states
Several conventions have also been opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the Convention on Cybercrime (signed for example, by [Canada](1956), Japan, South [Africa](1700) and the [United States](1100)), the Lisbon Recognition Convention on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by Australia, [Belarus](1683), [Canada](1956), the Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand and the [United States](1100)), the Anti-doping Convention (signed, for example, by Australia, [Belarus](1683), [Canada](1956) and Tunisia) and the Convention on the Conservation of [Europe](1994)an Wildlife and Natural Habitats (signed for example, by Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal as well as the [Europe](1994)an Community). Non-member states also participate in several partial agreements, such as the Venice Commission, the Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO), the [Europe](1994)an Pharmacopoeia Commission and the North-South Centre.
Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) on a case-by-case basis are sent to three groups of non-member entities:

Non-[Europe](1994)an states: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, South [Africa](1700), South Korea, Syria, Tajikistan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uruguay, Venezuela and the observers [Canada](1956), Israel, Japan, Mexico, [United States](1100).
[Europe](1994)an states: [Belarus](1683), Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Russia and the observer Holy See.
The [Europe](1994)an Community and later the [Europe](1994)an Union after its legal personality was established by the ratification of the EU's Lisbon Treaty.

[Europe](1994)an Union
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is not to be confused with the Council of the [Europe](1994)an Union (the "Council of Ministers") or the [Europe](1994)an Council. These belong to the [Europe](1994)an Union, which is separate from the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), although they have shared the same [Europe](1994)an flag and anthem since the 1980s since they both work for [Europe](1994)an integration. Nor is the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) to be confused with the [Europe](1994)an Union itself.
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) is an entirely separate body from the [Europe](1994)an Union. It is not controlled by it.
Cooperation between the [Europe](1994)an Union and the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) was reinforced in the mid-2000s, notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights.
The [Europe](1994)an Union is expected to accede to the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights (the convention). There are also concerns about consistency in case law – the [Europe](1994)an Court of Justice (the EU's court in Luxembourg) is treating the convention as part of the legal system of all EU member states in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the [Europe](1994)an Court of Human Rights (the court in Strasbourg interpreting the convention). Protocol No. 14 of the convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU Treaty of Lisbon contains a protocol binding the EU to join. The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are.

Schools of Political Studies
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Schools of Political Studies were established to train future generations of political, economic, social and cultural leaders in countries in transition. With the participation of national and international experts, they run annual series of seminars and conferences on topics such as [Europe](1994)an integration, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and globalisation. The first School of Political Studies was created in Moscow in 1992. By 2020, 20 other schools had been set up along the same lines, forming an association; a network covering the whole of Eastern and South-Eastern [Europe](1994) and the Caucasus, as well as some countries in the Southern Mediterranean region. The schools are part of the Education Department, which is part of the Directorate of Democratic Participation within the Directorate General of Democracy ("DGII") of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789).

United Nations
Cooperation between the CoE and the UN started with the agreement signed by the Secretariats of these institutions on 15 December 1951. On 17 October 1989, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved a resolution on granting observer status to the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) which was proposed by several member states of the CoE. Currently, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) holds observer status with the United Nations and is regularly represented in the UN General Assembly. It has organised the regional UN conferences against racism and on women. It co-operates with the United Nations at many levels, in particular in the areas of human rights, minorities, migration and counter-terrorism. In November 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus Resolution (A/Res/71/17) on Cooperation between the United Nations and the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) whereby it acknowledged the contribution of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) to the protection and strengthening of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, welcomed the ongoing co-operation in a variety of fields.

Non-governmental organisations
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can participate in the INGOs Conference of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and become observers to inter-governmental committees of experts. The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) drafted the [Europe](1994)an Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations in 1986, which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in [Europe](1994). Article 11 of the [Europe](1994)an Convention on Human Rights protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs. The rules for consultative status for INGOs appended to the resolution (93)38 "On relation between the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and non-governmental organisations", adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies. On 19 November 2003, the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status, "considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the Organisation's policy and work programme".

Others
On 30 May 2018, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) signed a memorandum of understanding with the [Europe](1994)an football confederation UEFA.
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) also signed an agreement with FIFA in which the two agreed to strengthen future cooperation in areas of common interests. The deal which included cooperation between member states in the sport of football and safety and security at football matches was finalized in October 2018.

Characteristics
Privileges and immunities
The General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) grants the organisation certain privileges and immunities.
The working conditions of staff are governed by the council's staff regulations, which are public. Salaries and emoluments paid by the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) to its officials are tax-exempt on the basis of Article 18 of the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789).

Symbol and anthem
The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) created, and has since 1955 used as its official symbol, the [Europe](1994)an Flag with 12 golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background.
Its musical anthem since 1972, the "[Europe](1994)an anthem", is based on the "Ode to Joy" theme from Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony.
On 5 May 1964, the 15th anniversary of its founding, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) established 5 May as [Europe](1994) Day.
The wide private and public use of the [Europe](1994)an Flag is encouraged to symbolise a [Europe](1994)an dimension. To avoid confusion with the [Europe](1994)an Union which subsequently adopted the same flag in the 1980s, as well as other [Europe](1994)an institutions, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) often uses a modified version with a lower-case "e" surrounding the stars which are referred to as the "[Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) Logo".

Criticism and controversies
Both Human Rights Watch and the [Europe](1994)an Stability Initiative have called on the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) to undertake concrete actions to show that it is willing and able to return to its "original mission to protect and ensure human rights", despite launching political and economic activities that could generate redundancies with other international organizations (including the [Europe](1994)an Union and OCSE).  
In October 2022, a new and different Pan-[Europe](1994)an meeting of 44 states was held, as the "inaugural summit of the [Europe](1994)an Political Community", a new forum largely organized by French President Emmanuel Macron. The [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), sidelined, reportedly was "perplexed" with this development, with a spokesperson stating "In the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, such a pan-[Europe](1994)an community already exists: it is the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)."  A feature of the new forum is that Russia and [Belarus](1683) are deliberately excluded, which was not seen as explaining the need for a different entity, given that at the time, Russia was no longer a member of the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) and [Belarus](1683) only participated partially, as a non-member.

"Caviar diplomacy" scandal
After [Azerbaijan](1588) joined the CoE in 2001, both the Council and its Parliamentary Assembly were criticised for having a weak response to election rigging and human rights violations in [Azerbaijan](1588). The Human Rights Watch criticised the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789) in 2014 for allowing [Azerbaijan](1588) to assume the six-month rotating chairmanship of the council's Committee of Ministers, writing that the Azeri government's repression of human rights defenders, dissidents, and journalists "shows sheer contempt for its commitments to the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789)". An internal inquiry was set up in 2017 amid allegations of bribery by [Azerbaijan](1588) government officials and criticism of "caviar diplomacy" at the Council. A 219-page report was issued in 2018 after a ten-month investigation. It concluded that several members of the Parliamentary Assembly broke CoE ethical rules and were "strongly suspected" of corruption; it strongly criticised former Parliamentary Assembly president Pedro Agramunt and suggested that he had engaged in "corruptive activities" before his resignation under pressure in 2017. The inquiry also named Italian member Luca Volontè as a suspect in "activities of a corruptive nature". Volontè was investigated by Italian police and accused by Italian prosecutors in 2017 of receiving over 2.39 million euros in bribes in exchange for working for [Azerbaijan](1588) in the parliamentary assembly, and that in 2013 he played a key role in orchestrating the defeat of a highly critical report on the abuse of political prisoners in [Azerbaijan](1588). In 2021, Volontè was convicted of accepting bribes from [Azerbaijan](1588)i officials to water down critiques of the nation's human rights record, and he was sentenced by a court in Milan to four years in prison.
