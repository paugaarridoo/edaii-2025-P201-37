Bilabial consonant
In phonetics, a bilabial consonant is a labial consonant articulated with both lips.

Frequency
Bilabial consonants are very common across languages. Only around 0.7% of the world's languages lack bilabial consonants altogether, including Tlingit, Chipewyan, Oneida, and Wichita, though all of these have a labial–velar approximant /w/.

Varieties
The bilabial consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) are:

Owere Igbo has a six-way contrast among bilabial stops: p pʰ ɓ̥ b b̤ ɓ.

Other varieties
The extensions to the IPA also define a bilabial percussive (ʬ ) for smacking the lips together. A lip-smack in the non-percussive sense of the lips audibly parting would be ʬ↓.
The IPA chart shades out bilabial lateral consonants, which is sometimes read as indicating that such sounds are not possible. The fricatives ɸ and β are often lateral, but since no language makes a distinction for centrality, the allophony is not noticeable.
