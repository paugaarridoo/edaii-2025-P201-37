1255
2023 Nobel Peace Prize
The [2023 Nobel Peace Prize](1255) was awarded to the Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi (born 1972) "for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all." She is the second Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Iran, following Shirin Ebadi, who won in 2003. As of the announcement of the prize in October 2023, Mohammadi was still imprisoned in Iran.

Laureate
In the 1990s, as a young physics student, Mohammadi was already distinguishing herself as an advocate for equality and women's rights. After her studies, she worked as an engineer as well as a columnist in various reform-minded newspapers. In 2003, she became involved with the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Tehran, which was founded by her fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Shirin Ebadi. 
In 2011, Mohammadi was arrested for the first time, and was sentenced to many years of imprisonment for her efforts to assist incarcerated activists and their families. Two years later, after her release on bail, she immersed herself in a campaign against use of the death penalty. Her activism against the death penalty led to her re-arrest in 2015, and to a sentence of additional years behind bars. After her return to prison, she began opposing the Iranian regime's systematic use of torture and sexualized violence against political prisoners, especially women, which is commonly practiced in Iranian prisons. 
In 2022, when the Mahsa Amini protests became known to the political prisoners being held inside the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran, Mohammadi once again assumed leadership. From prison she expressed support for the demonstrators, and organized solidarity actions among her fellow inmates. The prison authorities responded by imposing even stricter conditions, and she was prohibited from receiving phone calls and visitors. From captivity, Mohammadi helped to ensure that the protests did not subside.

Candidates
On February 22, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that they had received 305 nominations for the [2023 Nobel Peace Prize](1255), of which 212 are individuals and 93 are organizations. The number this year was fewer than the 343 candidates last year and the lowest since 2019. The highest number of candidates yet was in 2016. Though nominations are kept strictly secret, several Norwegian parliamentarians and other academics are privileged to publicly announce their preferred candidates to boost publicity both for the nominee and the nominator.
