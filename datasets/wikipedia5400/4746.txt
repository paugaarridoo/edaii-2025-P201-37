It is spoken on the islands Dugi, Kornati, Lošinj, Krk, Rab, Ugljan (except the southernmost Southern [Chakavian](4751) village of Kukljica, exhibiting many shared features with Ugljan's otherwise Central [Chakavian](4751) dialects) Pag, on the land the cities of Vinodol, Ogulin, Brinje, Otočac, the area around Duga Resa, part of Central and Northeastern Istria (including Čičarija dialect in Slovenian part), and Municipality of Kostanjevica na Krki (Oštrc, Črešnjevec pri Oštrcu, Črneča Vas, Vrtača, Vrbje) in Slovenia.
