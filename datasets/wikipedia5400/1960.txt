Cestoball
Cestoball is a sport created in [Argentina](1862) in 1897. During the conference in Buenos Aires and Santa Rosa in 1986, the sport changed the name to Cestoball with the purpose of making the old Argentine sport called 'pelota al cesto' (ball to basket) more dynamic and to bring its rules into closer harmony with korfball and netball.
