4014
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ([IEEE](4014)) is an American 501(c)(3) professional association for electrical engineering, electronics engineering, and other related disciplines.
The [IEEE](4014) has a corporate office in New York City and an operations center in Piscataway, New Jersey. The [IEEE](4014) was formed in 1963 as an amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers.

History
The [IEEE](4014) traces its founding to 1884 and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. In 1912, the rival Institute of Radio Engineers was formed. Although the AIEE was initially larger, the IRE attracted more students and was larger by the mid-1950s. The AIEE and IRE merged in 1963.
The [IEEE](4014) is headquartered in New York City, but most business is done at the [IEEE](4014) Operations Center in Piscataway, New Jersey, opened in 1975.
The Australian Section of the [IEEE](4014) existed between 1972 and 1985, after which it split into state- and territory-based sections.
As of 2023, [IEEE](4014) has over 460,000 members in 190 countries, with more than 66 percent from outside the [United States](1100).

Publications
[IEEE](4014) claims to produce over 30% of the world's literature in the electrical, electronics, and computer engineering fields, publishing approximately 200 peer-reviewed journals and magazines. [IEEE](4014) publishes more than 1,700 conference proceedings every year.
The published content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the [IEEE](4014) are available in the [IEEE](4014) Electronic Library (IEL) available through [IEEE](4014) Xplore platform, for subscription-based access and individual publication purchases.
In addition to journals and conference proceedings, the [IEEE](4014) also publishes tutorials and standards that are produced by its standardization committees. The organization also has its own [IEEE](4014) paper format.

Technical societies
[IEEE](4014) has 39 technical societies, each focused on a certain knowledge area, which provide specialized publications, conferences, business networking and other services.

Other bodies
[IEEE](4014) Global History Network
In September 2008, the [IEEE](4014) History Committee founded the [IEEE](4014) Global History Network, which now redirects to Engineering and Technology History Wiki.

[IEEE](4014) Foundation
The [IEEE](4014) Foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1973 to support and promote technology education, innovation, and excellence. It is incorporated separately from the [IEEE](4014), although it has a close relationship to it. Members of the Board of Directors of the foundation are required to be active members of [IEEE](4014), and one third of them must be current or former members of the [IEEE](4014) Board of Directors.
Initially, the role of the [IEEE](4014) Foundation was to accept and administer donations for the [IEEE](4014) Awards program, but donations increased beyond what was necessary for this purpose, and the scope was broadened. In addition to soliciting and administering unrestricted funds, the foundation also administers donor-designated funds supporting particular educational, humanitarian, historical preservation, and peer recognition programs of the [IEEE](4014). As of the end of 2014, the foundation's total assets were nearly $45 million, split equally between unrestricted and donor-designated funds.

Controversies
Huawei ban
In May 2019, [IEEE](4014) restricted Huawei employees from peer reviewing papers or handling papers as editors due to the "severe legal implications" of U.S. government sanctions against Huawei. As members of its standard-setting body, Huawei employees could continue to exercise their voting rights, attend standards development meetings, submit proposals and comment in public discussions on new standards. The ban sparked outrage among Chinese scientists on social media. Some professors in China decided to cancel their memberships.
On June 3, 2019, [IEEE](4014) lifted restrictions on Huawei's editorial and peer review activities after receiving clearance from the [United States](1100) government.

Position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine
On February 26, 2022, the chair of the [IEEE](4014) Ukraine Section, Ievgen Pichkalov, publicly appealed to the [IEEE](4014) members to "freeze [IEEE](4014) activities and membership in Russia" and requested "public reaction and strict disapproval of Russia's aggression" from the [IEEE](4014) and [IEEE](4014) Region 8. On March 17, 2022, an article in the form of Q&A interview with [IEEE](4014) Russia (Siberia) senior member Roman Gorbunov titled "A Russian Perspective on the War in Ukraine" was published in [IEEE](4014) Spectrum to demonstrate "the plurality of views among [IEEE](4014) members" and the "views that are at odds with international reporting on the war in Ukraine". On March 30, 2022, activist Anna Rohrbach created an open letter to the [IEEE](4014) in an attempt to have them directly address the article, stating that the article used "common narratives in Russian propaganda" on the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](1618) and requesting the [IEEE](4014) Spectrum to acknowledge "that they have unwittingly published a piece furthering misinformation and Russian propaganda." A few days later a note from the editors was added on April 6 with an apology "for not providing adequate context at the time of publication", though the editors did not revise the original article.
