Aunt Ruby's German Green
Aunt Ruby's German Green heirloom tomatoes are a cultivar originating with Ruby Arnold (d 1997), of Greeneville, Tennessee, but achieving great Seed Savers popularity. They are, as the name implies, "green" tomatoes, which really means they are a greenish yellow when fully ripe, but are still tasty when picked early.

Description
This tomato cultivar is an indeterminate plant that produces large (8–18-ounce or 230–510-gram) beefsteak fruit of especially irregular shapes, in somewhere between 69 and 80 days. This fruit won the Heirloom Garden Show's taste test, in 2003.
