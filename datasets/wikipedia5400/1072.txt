2018 Mediterranean Games
The 2018 Mediterranean Games (Catalan: Jocs Mediterranis de 2018, Spanish: Juegos Mediterráneos de 2018), officially known as the XVIII Mediterranean Games (Catalan: XVIII Jocs Mediterranis, Spanish: XVIII Juegos Mediterráneos) and commonly known as Tarragona 2018, was an international multi-sport event held from 22 June to 1 July 2018 in Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. Tarragona was announced as the host city at the ICMG General Assembly in Mersin, Turkey, on 15 October 2011.

Bidding process
The host city was announced during the ICMG General Assembly scheduled which took place in Mersin, Turkey (host of the [2013 Mediterranean Games](1066)) on 15 October 2011. The final candidates were Alexandria and Tarragona, where Tarragona won the vote 36–34.

 Alexandria, Egypt
Alexandria hosted the first Mediterranean Games and planned to build a new Olympic Village for the 2017 Mediterranean Games in the iconic South Mediterranean city.

 Tarragona, Spain
Under the motto "History making history", Tarragona planned to take the Games to Spain for the third time after the [1955 Mediterranean Games](1020) in [Barcelona](1000) and the [2005 Mediterranean Games](1060) in Almería.

Development and preparation
The International Committee of the Mediterranean Games (ICMG) announced in November 2016 that Tarragona was postponing its hosting of the Mediterranean Games from 2017 to 2018 due to funding problems caused by Spanish political and economical instability.
Some doubts were expressed in 2017 about the holding of the games due to the 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis after the Catalan government unilaterally declared independence on 27 October.

Marketing
Tarracus, a humanoid character wearing a Roman helmet, was unveiled as the mascot for 2018 Mediterranean Games in May 2016. The pattern on the helmet plume is based on the flag of Tarragona.
