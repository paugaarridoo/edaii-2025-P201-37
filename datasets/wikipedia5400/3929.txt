Restoration (Spain)
The Restoration (Spanish: Restauración) or Bourbon Restoration (Spanish: Restauración borbónica) was the period in Spanish history between the First Spanish Republic and the [Second Spanish Republic](3933) from 1874 to 1931. It began on 29 December 1874, after a coup d'état by General Arsenio Martínez Campos ended the First Spanish Republic and restored the monarchy under [Alfonso XII](3308), and ended on 14 April 1931 with the proclamation of the [Second Spanish Republic](3933).
After nearly a century of political instability and several civil wars, the Restoration attempted to establish a new political system that ensured stability through the practice of turno, an intentional rotation of liberal and conservative parties in leadership often achieved through electoral fraud. Critics of the system included republicans, socialists, anarchists, Basque and Catalan nationalists, and Carlists.

Characteristics
The Restoration period was characterized by political instability, economic challenges, and social unrest. Key issues that defined the period include:

Political conservatism: The Restoration was marked by a resurgence of conservative politics and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. King [Alfonso XII](3308) successfully restored stability after years of political upheaval and turmoil. However, this stability was often maintained through repression and the silencing of genuine opposition.
Economic struggles: During the Restoration, Spain faced economic difficulties such as high unemployment and inflation. The country also suffered from significant social inequality, with a small but wealthy elite controlling most of Spain's resources.
Social unrest: The period witnessed social upheaval and the growth of socialist and anarchist movements. These groups sought to address the social and economic inequalities within Spanish society and often clashed with the conservative government.
Regional tensions: Spain has a long history of regional tensions, which intensified during the Restoration. Various movements for greater autonomy emerged in regions such as [Catalonia](2549) and the Basque Country.
War: In 1898, Spain lost nearly all its remaining colonies in the Spanish-American War, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. This defeat was a major blow to Spanish national pride and significantly impacted the country's economy and politics. Conflict with Morocco, coming to a head in the Rif War, worsened economic conditions and morale.
Cultural revival: Despite political and economic challenges, Spain experienced a cultural revival during this period. Spanish art, literature, and music experienced renewed interest, and many important cultural figures emerged.

[Alfonso XII](3308) and the Regency of Maria Christina (1874–1898)
On 29 December 1874, General Arsenio Martínez Campos's pronunciamiento overthrew the First Spanish Republic and restored the monarchy, crowning [Alfonso XII](3308), son of the exiled Isabella II, as king. 
The Constitution of 1876 was soon established; it remained in force throughout the Restoration. This constitution established Spain as a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature (Cortes Generales) consisting of an upper house (Senate) and a lower house (Congress of Deputies). The king held the power to appoint senators and to annul laws at his discretion. He was given the honorific title of Commander-in-Chief of the army.
These were years of economic prosperity. Since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Spain's economy had lagged even further behind that of other European countries. During this time, the country underwent significant modernization. Domestic production was expanded in most areas, supported by a highly protectionist policy.
The Liberal Party, led by Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and the Conservative Party, led by Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, alternated in power through the controlled process of el turno pacífico. Local figures, known as caciques, manipulated the election results, fueling growing resentment of the system. This led to the formation of major nationalist movements and unions in [Catalonia](2549), Galicia, and the Basque Country.
[Alfonso XII](3308) died in November 1885 from a recurrence of dysentery. At that time, his wife Maria Cristina was pregnant. Their son [Alfonso XII](3308)I was born on 17 May 1886, and a Regency was formed, headed by the Queen Mother Maria Cristina.

Reign of [Alfonso XII](3308)I and crisis of the system (1898–1923)
In 1898, the Spanish–American War led to the loss of Spain's last major overseas colonies, including Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. This rapid collapse devastated Spain and damaged the credibility of the government and its associated ideologies. It also nearly caused a military coup d'état led by General Camilo García de Polavieja. This event marked the beginning of the country's decline, giving rise to numerous conflicting opposition movements at local and national levels.
[Alfonso XII](3308)I came of age in May 1902 and was crowned on 17 May 1902, ending the regency of the Queen Mother.
Spain began its international rehabilitation after the Algeciras Conference of 1906. In 1907, it signed the Pact of Cartagena with France and Great Britain, a defensive alliance against the Triple Alliance. The Spanish government was able to begin rebuilding its fleet and built the España-class battleship and the Reina Victoria Eugenia-class battleship. 
In 1909, failed attempts to conquer Morocco led to domestic discontent, culminating in a revolt known as the Semana Tragica in [Barcelona](1000). The rebellion, led mainly by lower-class citizens and supported by anarchists, communists, and republicans, was a response to what they saw as unfair practices in recruiting soldiers. The government declared a state of war and sent in troops to put down the uprising, which resulted in more than a hundred deaths and the execution of Francisco Ferrer. The socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) attempted to organize a national general strike, but the unions were only able to mobilize urban workers.
When World War I broke out in 1914, the Italian government declared its neutrality, allowing Spain to do the same. Spain's neutrality led to economic growth. In 1918-1920, the flu pandemic resulted in the death of 200,000 Spaniards (1% of the population).
In 1921, conflict in Morocco escalated, beginning the Rif War. A group of Moroccan militants launched a surprise attack on the Spanish army. Led by the Moroccan chieftain Abd-Al-Krim, Moroccans nearly annihilated the Spanish forces and pushed them back toward Melilla in the Battle of Annual. The top military officers were blamed for the Spanish defeat due to poor planning. This led to lowered morale among the military, who felt misunderstood as they were ordered to advance inland without adequate resources to occupy the difficult terrain.

Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923–1930)
Military and civil unrest grew, amplified by fears of anarchist terrorism or proletarian revolution and the rise of nationalist movements. On 13 September 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Captain General of [Catalonia](2549), staged a coup d'état and deposed Prime Minister Manuel García Prieto after issuing a manifesto blaming Spain's problems on the parliamentary system. [Alfonso XII](3308)I supported the general and appointed him the new prime minister. 
Primo de Rivera suspended the constitution and assumed absolute powers as a dictator. He created the Unión Patriótica Española, the only recognized political party, and banned all others. He increased spending on businesses and public services, which led to the bankruptcy of his government. As a result of these actions, the military withdrew their support. [Alfonso XII](3308)I did the same and forced him to resign in January 1930.

Final year (1930–1931)
[Alfonso XII](3308)I attempted to gradually restore the previous system and bolster his prestige by enlisting General Dámaso Berenguer as Prime Minister. However, due to the king's perceived support of the dictatorship, this proved unsuccessful and led to growing calls for the establishment of a republic. On  17 August 1930, republican groups formed the Pact of San Sebastián, forming a revolutionary committee that would later become the leadership of the [Second Spanish Republic](3933). 
Berenguer eventually resigned, and the king appointed Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar in his place. On 12 April 1931, Aznar called for local elections to appease the democrats and republicans, replace the local governing bodies of the dictatorship, and gradually restore the restoration.
Although the monarchists still had some support, the republican and socialist parties won an overwhelming victory. Their victory led to street riots and demands for the abolition of the monarchy. On 14 April, the king fled Spain after the army announced it would not defend him. A provisional government led by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora immediately established the [Second Spanish Republic](3933).
