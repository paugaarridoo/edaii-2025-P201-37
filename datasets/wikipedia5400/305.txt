Ace the Wonder Dog
Ace the Wonder [Dog](300) was a German Shepherd dog actor in several films and film serials from 1938 to 1946.  His first appearance was in the 1938 Lew Landers film Blind Alibi. He is considered by many critics an attempt by RKO Pictures to cash in on the success of Warner Bros.' canine sensation, Rin Tin Tin, also a German Shepherd.  
After making several program pictures for RKO, Ace moved to Republic Pictures for several more projects, before moving to Columbia Pictures for a role as the Phantom's sidekick "Devil" in the serial The Phantom in 1943.

His declining popularity meant that most of his appearances after RKO's initial burst of "Ace" publicity were for Monogram and the Poverty Row studio Producers Releasing Corporation.  In 1945, he appeared as "Rusty" in The Adventures of Rusty, the first of Columbia's eight "Rusty" films.  He did not reprise the role in any of the subsequent installments.
Ace is just one of a number of "Wonder [Dog](300)s" in the history of fictional dogs.  Others include Rin Tin Tin (billed during his 1930 radio show as "Rin Tin Tin, the Wonder [Dog](300)"), Pal the Wonder [Dog](300), Gaspode the Wonder [Dog](300), Rex the Wonder [Dog](300) from silent films, and another unrelated Rex the Wonder [Dog](300) from DC Comics. Ace presumptively died sometime after 1946.
