Charing Cross Theatre
The Charing Cross Theatre is an Off West End theatre under The Arches off Villiers Street below Charing Cross station. Founded in 1936, the venue occupied several premises in the West End of London before locating to its present site. The current site, from1946 to 2002, presented Victorian-style music hall under the name Players' Theatre. It was refurbished in 2005 and reopened under new management in 2006 as The New Players Theatre, before being taken under new management by Broadway producer Steven M. Levy and Sean Sweeney in 2011, when the theatre changed its name to the Charing Cross Theatre, with the Players Bar & Kitchen.
It is one of the smallest West End Theatres, rebuilt to meet the demands of national and international producers wanting a theatre which offers a degree of intimacy and is the equivalent in size of an off-Broadway space.
With the appointment of Thom Southerland as Artistic Director in 2016, Charing Cross Theatre announced it was turning into a producing house launching with a number of major musicals.
