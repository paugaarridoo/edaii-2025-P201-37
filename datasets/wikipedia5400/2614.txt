Bangers and mash
Bangers and mash, also known as sausages and mash, is a traditional British dish consisting of sausages and mashed potato. It may consist of one of a variety of flavoured sausages made of pork, lamb, beef, or a meat alternative. The dish is usually served with onion gravy, but may also include fried onions and peas.

This dish, even when cooked at home, may be thought of as an example of pub grub, meaning it is relatively quick and easy to make in large quantities.
In 2009, the dish was listed as Britain's most popular comfort food in a survey commissioned by TV channel Good Food.

Etymology
Although it is sometimes stated that the term banger has its origins in World War II, it is recorded in use at least as far back as 1919. The term is said to have originated from the fact that sausages produced during the meat rationing of World War I were made with such a high water content that they were liable to explode when cooked.
