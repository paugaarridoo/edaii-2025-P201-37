1900
[1900](4505) (MCM) was an exceptional common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar and a leap year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar, the [1900](4505)th year of the Common Era (CE) and [Anno Domini](1555) (AD) designations, the 900th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 100th and last year of the 19th century, and the  1st   year of the [1900](4505)s decade. As of the start of [1900](4505), the Gregorian calendar was 12 days ahead of the Julian calendar, which remained in localized use until 1923.
