4799
Croatian language
[Croatia](4797)n ( ; hrvatski xř̩ʋaːtskiː) is the standardised variety of the Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n pluricentric language mainly used by Croats. It is the national official language and literary standard of [Croatia](4797), one of the official languages of [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), Montenegro, the Serbian province of Vojvodina, the [European Union](1200) and a recognized minority language elsewhere in Serbia and other neighbouring countries.
In the mid-18th century, the first attempts to provide a [Croatia](4797)n literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional lingua franca – pushing back regional [Chakavian](4751), Kajkavian, and Shtokavian vernaculars. The decisive role was played by [Croatia](4797)n Vukovians, who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to designing a phonological orthography. [Croatia](4797)n is written in Gaj's Latin alphabet.
Besides the Shtokavian dialect, on which Standard [Croatia](4797)n is based, there are two other main supradialects spoken on the territory of [Croatia](4797), [Chakavian](4751) and Kajkavian. These supradialects, and the four national standards, are usually subsumed under the term "Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n" in English; this term is controversial for native speakers, and names such as "Bosnian-[Croatia](4797)n-Montenegrin-Serbian" (BCMS) are used by linguists and philologists in the 21st century.
In 1997, the [Croatia](4797)n Parliament established the Days of the [Croatia](4797)n Language from March 11 to 17. Since 2013, the Institute of [Croatia](4797)n language has been celebrating the Month of the [Croatia](4797)n Language, from February 21 (International Mother Language Day) to March 17 (the day of signing the Declaration on the Name and Status of the [Croatia](4797)n Literary Language).

History
Modern language and standardization
In the late medieval period up to the 17th century, the majority of semi-autonomous [Croatia](4797) was ruled by two domestic dynasties of princes (banovi), the Zrinski and the Frankopan, which were linked by inter-marriage. Toward the 17th century, both of them attempted to unify [Croatia](4797) both culturally and linguistically, writing in a mixture of all three principal dialects ([Chakavian](4751), Kajkavian and Shtokavian), and calling it "[Croatia](4797)n", "Dalmatian", or "Slavonian". Historically, several other names were used as synonyms for [Croatia](4797)n, in addition to Dalmatian and Slavonian, and these were Illyrian (ilirski) and Slavic (slovinski). It is still used now in parts of Istria, which became a crossroads of various mixtures of [Chakavian](4751) with Ekavian, Ijekavian and Ikavian isoglosses.
The most standardised form (Kajkavian–Ikavian) became the cultivated language of administration and intellectuals from the Istrian peninsula along the [Croatia](4797)n coast, across central [Croatia](4797) up into the northern valleys of the Drava and the Mura. The cultural apex of this 17th century idiom is represented by the editions of "Adrianskoga mora sirena" ("The Siren of the Adriatic Sea") by Petar Zrinski and "Putni tovaruš" ("Traveling escort") by Katarina Zrinska.
However, this first linguistic renaissance in [Croatia](4797) was halted by the political execution of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan by the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I in Vienna in 1671. Subsequently, the [Croatia](4797)n elite in the 18th century gradually abandoned this combined [Croatia](4797)n standard.

Illyrian period
The Illyrian movement was a 19th-century pan-South Slavic political and cultural movement in [Croatia](4797) that had the goal to standardise the regionally differentiated and orthographically inconsistent literary languages in [Croatia](4797), and finally merge them into a common South Slavic literary language. Specifically, three major groups of dialects were spoken on [Croatia](4797)n territory, and there had been several literary languages over four centuries. The leader of the Illyrian movement Ljudevit Gaj standardized the Latin alphabet in 1830–1850 and worked to bring about a standardized orthography. Although based in Kajkavian-speaking Zagreb, Gaj supported using the more populous Neo-Shtokavian – a version of Shtokavian that eventually became the predominant dialectal basis of both [Croatia](4797)n and Serbian literary language from the 19th century on. Supported by various South Slavic proponents, Neo-Shtokavian was adopted after an [Austria](1585)n initiative at the Vienna Literary Agreement of 1850, laying the foundation for the unified Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n literary language. The uniform Neo-Shtokavian then became common in the [Croatia](4797)n elite.
In the 1860s, the Zagreb Philological School dominated the [Croatia](4797)n cultural life, drawing upon linguistic and ideological conceptions advocated by the members of the Illyrian movement. While it was dominant over the rival Rijeka Philological School and Zadar Philological Schools, its influence waned with the rise of the [Croatia](4797)n Vukovians (at the end of the 19th century).

Distinguishing features and differences between standards
[Croatia](4797)n is commonly characterized by the ijekavian pronunciation (see an explanation of yat reflexes), the sole use of the Latin alphabet, and a number of lexical differences in common words that set it apart from standard Serbian. Some differences are absolute, while some appear mainly in the frequency of use. However, as professor John F. Bailyn states, "an examination of all the major 'levels' of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system."

Sociopolitical standpoints
[Croatia](4797)n, although technically a form of Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n, is sometimes considered a distinct language by itself. This is at odds with purely linguistic classifications of languages based on mutual intelligibility (abstand and ausbau languages), which do not allow varieties that are mutually intelligible to be considered separate languages. "There is no doubt of the near 100% mutual intelligibility of (standard) [Croatia](4797)n and (standard) Serbian, as is obvious from the ability of all groups to enjoy each others' films, TV and sports broadcasts, newspapers, rock lyrics etc.", writes Bailyn. Differences between various standard forms of Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n are often exaggerated for political reasons. Most [Croatia](4797)n linguists regard [Croatia](4797)n as a separate language that is considered key to national identity, in the sense that the term [Croatia](4797)n language includes all language forms from the earliest times to the present, in all areas where Croats live, as realized in the speeches of [Croatia](4797)n dialects, in city speeches and jargons, and in the [Croatia](4797)n standard language. The issue is sensitive in [Croatia](4797) as the notion of a separate language being the most important characteristic of a nation is widely accepted, stemming from the 19th-century history of Europe. The 1967 Declaration on the Status and Name of the [Croatia](4797)n Literary Language, in which a group of [Croatia](4797)n authors and linguists demanded greater autonomy for [Croatia](4797)n, is viewed in [Croatia](4797) as a linguistic policy milestone that was also a general milestone in national politics. 
On the 50th anniversary of the Declaration, at the beginning of 2017, a two-day meeting of experts from [Croatia](4797), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro was organized in Zagreb, at which the text of the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs and Montenegrins was drafted. The new Declaration has received more than ten thousand signatures. It states that in [Croatia](4797), Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro a common polycentric standard language is used, consisting of several standard varieties, similar to the existing varieties of German, English or Spanish. The aim of the new Declaration is to stimulate discussion on language without the nationalistic baggage and to counter nationalistic divisions.
The terms "Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n", "Serbo-Croat", or "Croato-Serbian", are still used as a cover term for all these forms by foreign scholars, even though the speakers themselves largely do not use it. Within ex-Yugoslavia, the term has largely been replaced by the ethnopolitical terms Bosnian, [Croatia](4797)n, Montenegrin, and Serbian.
The use of the name "[Croatia](4797)n" for a language has historically been attested to, though not always distinctively. The first printed [Croatia](4797)n literary work is a vernacular [Chakavian](4751) poem written in 1501 by Marko Marulić, titled "The History of the Holy Widow Judith Composed in [Croatia](4797)n Verses". The [Croatia](4797)n–Hungarian Agreement designated [Croatia](4797)n as one of its official languages. [Croatia](4797)n became an official EU language upon accession of [Croatia](4797) to the [European Union](1200) on 1 July 2013. In 2013, the EU started publishing a [Croatia](4797)n-language version of its official gazette.

Official status
Standard [Croatia](4797)n is the official language of the Republic of [Croatia](4797) and, along with Standard Bosnian and Standard Serbian, one of three official languages of [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571). It is also official in the regions of [Burgenland](4585) ([Austria](1585)), Molise (Italy) and Vojvodina (Serbia). Additionally, it has co-official status alongside Romanian in the communes of Carașova and Lupac, Romania. In these localities, Croats or Krashovani make up the majority of the population, and education, signage and access to public administration and the justice system are provided in [Croatia](4797)n, alongside Romanian.
[Croatia](4797)n is officially used and taught at all universities in [Croatia](4797) and at the University of Mostar in [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571). Studies of [Croatia](4797)n language are held in Hungary (Institute of Philosophy at the ELTE Faculty of Humanities in [Budapest](4580)), Slovakia (Faculty of Philosophy of the Comenius University in Bratislava), Poland (University of Warsaw, Jagiellonian University, University of Silesia in Katowice, University of Wroclaw, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan), Germany (University of Regensburg), [Australia](1659) (Center for [Croatia](4797)n Studies at the Macquarie University), Northern Macedonia (Faculty of Philology in Skopje) etc.
[Croatia](4797)n embassies hold courses for learning [Croatia](4797)n in Poland, United Kingdom and a few other countries. Extracurricular education of [Croatia](4797)n is hold in Germany in [Baden-Württemberg](4546), [Berlin](1387), Hamburg and Saarland, as well as in North Macedonia in Skopje, Bitola, Štip and Kumanovo. Some [Croatia](4797)n Catholic Missions also hold [Croatia](4797)n language courses (for. ex. CCM in [Buenos Aires](4736)).
There is no regulatory body that determines the proper usage of [Croatia](4797)n. However, in January 2023, the [Croatia](4797)n Parliament passed a law that prescribes the official use of the [Croatia](4797)n language, regulates the establishment of the Council for the [Croatia](4797)n language as a coordinating advisory body whose work will be focused on the protection and development of the [Croatia](4797)n language. State authorities, local and regional self-government entities are obliged to use the [Croatia](4797)n language.
The current standard language is generally laid out in the grammar books and dictionaries used in education, such as the school curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education and the university programmes of the Faculty of Philosophy at the four main universities. In 2013, a Hrvatski pravopis by the Institute of [Croatia](4797)n Language and Linguistics received an official sole seal of approval from the Ministry of Education.
The most prominent recent editions describing the [Croatia](4797)n standard language are:

Hrvatski pravopis by the Institute of [Croatia](4797)n Language and Linguistics, available online
Hrvatski jezični portal by University Computing Centre (Srce) and Znanje, available online.

Rječnik hrvatskoga jezika by Jure Šonje et al.
Hrvatski enciklopedijski rječnik, by a group of authors
Hrvatska gramatika by Eugenija Barić et al.
Also notable are the recommendations of Matica hrvatska, the national publisher and promoter of [Croatia](4797)n heritage, and the Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography, as well as the [Croatia](4797)n Academy of Sciences and Arts.
Numerous representative [Croatia](4797)n linguistic works were published since the independence of [Croatia](4797), among them three voluminous monolingual dictionaries of contemporary [Croatia](4797)n.
In 2021, [Croatia](4797) introduced a new model of linguistic categorisation of the Bunjevac dialect (as part of New-Shtokavian Ikavian dialects of the Shtokavian dialect of the [Croatia](4797)n language) in three sub-branches: Dalmatian (also called Bosnian-Dalmatian), Danubian (also called Bunjevac), and Littoral-Lika. Its speakers largely use the Latin alphabet and are living in parts of [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), different parts of [Croatia](4797), southern parts (inc. [Budapest](4580)) of Hungary as well in the autonomous province Vojvodina of Serbia.
The Institute of [Croatia](4797)n Language and Linguistics added the Bunjevac dialect to the List of Protected Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Republic of [Croatia](4797) on 8 October 2021.
