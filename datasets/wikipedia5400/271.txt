Basset Hound
The [Basset](267) Hound is a short-legged breed of dog in the hound family. The [Basset](267) is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to the [Bloodhound](294).
[Basset](267) Hounds are one of six recognized "basset"-type breeds in France. The name [Basset](267) is derived from the French word bas, meaning 'low', with the attenuating suffix -et—together meaning 'rather low'. [Basset](267) Hounds are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard hound coloration.

Description
Appearance
[Basset](267)s are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kg (44 and 77 pounds). This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.

This breed, like its ancestor the [Bloodhound](294), has a hanging skin structure, which causes the face to tend to have a sad look; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The loose elastic skin around the neck is known as the dewlap.
The coat is short, generally black, white and tan tricolor or tan and white bicolor, but with many other possible colors. The EM allele produces a black mask on the face that may extend up around the eyes and onto the ears. This pattern is most easily seen on mahogany dogs, although any [Basset](267) color pattern may express the EM allele, except for "red and white" or "lemon and white" due to e/e.

Temperament
The [Basset](267) Hound is a friendly, outgoing, and playful dog, tolerant of children and other pets.

Health
Osteochondrodysplasia
The [Basset](267) Hound's short stature is due to the genetic condition osteochondrodysplasia. Osteochondrodysplasia causes stunted growth and impacts movement. Affected dogs develop splayed hind limbs, enlarged joints, flattened rib cages, shortened and bent long bones, and deformed paws.

Life expectancy
The breed has a median life span of 10–12 years. A 2015 French study found a life expectancy of 10.3 years. A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 12.5 years compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Other health issues
[Basset](267) Hounds are prone to yeast infections.
Leading causes of death in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey were cancer (31%), old age (13%), gastric dilatation volvulus (11%), and cardiac (8%).
Information from veterinary data found the prevalence of glaucoma to be 5.44%, second highest in the study.
The [Basset](267) Hound is predisposed to gastric dilatation volvulus. One study found the odds ratio to be 5.9.
[Basset](267) Hound hereditary thrombopathy is an autosomally inherited platelet disorder characterised by a thrombasthenia defect in primary aggregation abnormality of clot retraction. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa is defective although detectable.
The [Basset](267) Hound is prone to several skin conditions: allergic skin disease; intertrigo; Malassezia dermatitis; and otitis, primary keratinization defects.
The [Basset](267) Hound is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary open angle glaucoma. An autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

History
St Hubert's Hound
The [Basset](267) type originated in France, and is descended from the 6th-century hounds belonging to St Hubert of Belgium, which through breeding at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Hubert eventually became what is known as the St Hubert's Hound around 1000 AD. St Hubert's original hounds are descended from the Laconian (Spartan) Hound, one of four groups of dogs discerned from Greek representations and descriptions. These scent hounds were described as large, slow, "short-legged and deep mouthed" dogs with a small head, straight nose, upright ears and long neck, and either tan with white markings or black with tan markings. Laconian Hounds were reputed to not give up the scent until they found their prey. They eventually found their way to Constantinople, and from there to Europe.

France
The first mention of a "[Basset](267)" dog appeared in La Venerie, an illustrated hunting text written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585.  The name "[Basset](267)" has its origins in the Latin word for low, bassus, and the French diminutive -et.  The dogs in Fouilloux's text were used to hunt foxes and badgers. It is believed that the [Basset](267) type originated as a mutation in the litters of Norman Staghounds, a descendant of the St Hubert's Hound. These precursors were most likely bred back to the St. Hubert's Hound, among other derivative French hounds. Until after the French Revolution around the year 1789, hunting from horseback was the preserve of kings, large aristocratic families and of the country squires, and for this reason short-legged dogs were highly valued for hunting on foot.
[Basset](267)-type hounds became popular during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (r. 1852–1870). In 1853, Emmanuel Fremiet, "the leading sculptor of animals in his day" exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III's [Basset](267) Hounds at the Paris Salon. Ten years later in 1863 at the first exhibition of dogs held in Paris, [Basset](267) Hounds attained international attention.
The controlled breeding of the short haired [Basset](267) began in France in 1870. From the existing [Basset](267)s, Count Le Couteulx of Canteleu fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs known as the Chien d'Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane developed a more spectacular type, with crooked front legs, known as the [Basset](267) Normand. These were bred together to create the original [Basset](267) Artésien Normand.

England
French [Basset](267) Hounds were being imported into England at least as early as the 1870s. While some of these dogs were certainly [Basset](267) Artésien Normands, by the 1880s linebreeding had thrown back to a different heavier type. Everett Millais, who is considered to be the father of the modern [Basset](267) Hound, bred one such dog, Nicholas, to a [Bloodhound](294) bitch named Inoculation through artificial insemination in order to create a heavier [Basset](267) in England in the 1890s. The litter was delivered by caesarean section, and the surviving pups were refined with French and English [Basset](267)s. The first breed standard for what is now known as the [Basset](267) Hound was made in Great Britain at the end of 19th century. This standard was updated in 2010.

Hunting with [Basset](267)s
The [Basset](267) Hound was bred to hunt, with a keen nose and short stature suited to small-game hunting on foot. A variety of [Basset](267) Hound developed purely for hunting by Colonel Morrison was admitted to the Masters of [Basset](267) Hounds Association in 1959 via an appendix to the Stud Book. This breed differs in being straighter and longer in the leg and having shorter ears.
