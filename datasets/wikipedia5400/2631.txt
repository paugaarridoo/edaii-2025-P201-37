Carne asada fries
Carne asada fries are a local dish speciality found on the menus of restaurants primarily in the [American Southwest](1186), including San Diego,  where it originated.

History
Carne asada fries are a Mexican-American dish originating in the Chicano community in San Diego. This item is not normally featured on the menu at more traditional Mexican restaurants. Lolita's Mexican Food in San Diego claims to have originated the dish in the late 1990s, inspired by a suggestion from their tortilla distributor.

The dish is also served at Petco Park  and Dodger Stadium. By 2015, fast food chain Del Taco began to sell the item.

Ingredients
The dish typically consists of french fries, carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and sometimes salsa.  Typically, the fries are of the shoestring variety, but other cuts may be used as well. The carne asada is usually finely chopped to avoid the need for a knife or additional cutting on the part of the consumer. The cheese is commonly cotija, although many establishments use a less-costly shredded cheese mix which melts with the other ingredients and keeps longer.
In Los Angeles, the dish may also contain refried beans.
The dish is high in calories, with a meal-sized portion containing 2000 calories or more.
