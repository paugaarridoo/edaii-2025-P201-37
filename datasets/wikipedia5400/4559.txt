Belgian French
Belgian French (French: français de Belgique) is the variety of French spoken mainly among the French Community of [Belgium](197), alongside related Oïl languages of the region such as Walloon, Picard, Champenois, and Lorrain (Gaumais). The French language spoken in [Belgium](197) differs very little from that of France or Switzerland. It is characterized by the use of some terms that are considered archaic in France, as well as loanwords from languages such as Walloon, Picard, and Belgian Dutch. 
French is one of the three official languages of [Belgium](197), along with Dutch and German. It is spoken natively by around 40% of the population, primarily in the regions of Wallonia and [Brussels](4578). The French spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi is largely based on Belgian French, as all three countries are former colonies of [Belgium](197).

Influences
While a number of Oïl languages have traditionally been spoken in different areas of Wallonia, French emerged as the regional language of literature in the 13th century. This was a result of heavy French cultural influence on the region over the past few centuries. The diversity of local languages influenced French in Wallonia, with words from Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Lorrain making their way into the local variant. Until the 20th century, Walloon was the majority language of Wallonia, and most speakers were bilingual in French and Walloon.
While the French spoken in Wallonia was influenced by local languages, the variant spoken in [Brussels](4578) was influenced by Dutch, specifically the local [Brabantian dialect](4493). The population of the city, situated in the region of Flanders, originally was largely Dutch-speaking, aside from a French-speaking aristocracy. A gradual Francisation of the population began in the 19th century and  continued throughout the 20th century, as French emerged as the dominant language of the city. The local dialect of [Brussels](4578) includes some loanwords from Dutch, as well as expressions that have been translated into French.

Phonology
There are a few consistent phonological differences between the French in France and [Belgium](197) but usually no more than the differences between regional dialects within France (or the ones that exist between the English of Toronto and Vancouver (Canada) for instance), which might even be nonexistent. Regional accents however, can vary from city to city (the Liège accent being an example). However, on the whole, accents may vary more according to one's social class and education.

While stronger accents have been more typical of the working class, they have become much less pronounced since World War I and the widespread use of television, which has helped to standardise accents and the types of words used by speakers. Belgian speakers are taught the pronunciation of standard Belgian French in schools. The following differences vary by speaker, according to level of education, age and native region:

The lack of /ɥ/. The combination /ɥi/ is replaced by /wi/, and in other cases, /ɥ/ becomes a full vowel /y/. Thus, enfuir (to run away) and enfouir (to bury) are pronounced the same, unlike in France and Quebec.
The nasal vowels are pronounced like in France: /ɑ̃/ → ɒ̃, /ɛ̃/ → æ̃, /ɔ̃/ → õ, but the distinction between the nasal vowels /ɛ̃/ and /œ̃/ has been retained in [Belgium](197), but in many regions of France such as Paris, the two have merged. For example, in [Belgium](197), brin (stalk) and brun (brown) are still pronounced differently, like in Quebec but unlike in Paris.
The distinction between the vowels /o/ and /ɔ/ has been maintained in final open syllables. For example, peau (skin) and pot (jar) are still pronounced differently, unlike in France and Quebec.
There are more distinctions between long and short vowels than Quebec French; all the circumflexes are pronounced:
The distinction between the vowels /ɛ/ and /ɛː/ is still present in [Belgium](197), but they have merged in France: mettre (put) mɛtʁ̥ and maître (master) mɛːtʁ̥. Otherwise, many words are pronounced with a long /ɛː/ even if there is no circumflex: peine pɛːn and reine ʁɛːn, etc.
The phonemes /i/ and /iː/ are still distinct in [Belgium](197), unlike in France and Quebec: il il vs. île iːl.
The phonemes /y/ and /yː/ are still distinct in [Belgium](197), unlike in France and Quebec: chute ʃyt vs. flûte flyːt.
The phonemes /u/ and /uː/ are still distinct in [Belgium](197), unlike in France and Quebec: toute tut vs. croûte kʁ̥uːt.
The phonemes /ɔ/ and /oː/ are still distinct, unlike in Southern France: cote kɔt vs. côte koːt
The phonemes /œ/ and /øː/ are still distinct, unlike in Southern France: jeune ʒœn vs. jeûne ʒøːn.
Long vowels are also used in open syllables in [Belgium](197), even at the end of a word: ⟨ée⟩, ⟨aie⟩ eː#, ⟨ue⟩ yː#, ⟨ie⟩ iː#, ⟨oue⟩ uː# and ⟨eue⟩ øː#. As a result, almost all feminine adjectives are still phonetically distinct from their masculine counterparts in [Belgium](197), unlike in France and Quebec.
The vowels /a/ and /ɑ/ are still distinct in [Belgium](197), but the marginal phoneme /ɑ/ is usually pronounced as a lengthened version of /a/: pâte (paste) paːt.
The letter "w" is almost always pronounced as /w/, like in English, which also approximates the Flemish "w". In France and Quebec, in many words, "w" is pronounced /v/, as in German. For example, the word wagon (train car) is pronounced /vaɡɔ̃/ in France and Quebec, but /waɡɔ̃/ in [Belgium](197).
Some speakers devoice final stops, in which case d is pronounced like t, b is pronounced like p and g is pronounced like k. In combination with the dropping of consonants (/l, ʁ/) in final consonant clusters, this leads to pronunciations such as grande ɡʁɒ̃ːt instead of ɡʁɒ̃ːd, table taːp instead of tabl, and tigre tik instead of tiɡʁ.
For some speakers, the short high vowels /i, y, u/ are realised as lax in closed syllables: ɪ, ʏ, ʊ.
Certain accents, such as in certain cities (notably [Brussels](4578) and Liège) and those of speakers who are older and particularly less educated, are farther from the pronunciation of France. For example, in the dialect in and around Liège, especially for older speakers, the letter "h" is pronounced in certain positions. It is always silent, however, in Standard French. That dialect is known also for its slow, slightly "singing" intonation, a trait that is even stronger towards the east, in the Verviers area.

Vocabulary
Words unique to Belgian French are called "Belgicisms" (French: belgicismes). (This term is also used to refer to Dutch words used in [Belgium](197) but not in the Netherlands.) In general, the Francophone and educated speakers understand the meaning and use of words in Standard French, and they may also use Standard French if they speak with non-Belgians who speak in Standard French, as their accent hints. Overall, the lexical differences between Standard French and Belgian French are minor. They could be compared to the differences that might exist between two speakers of American English living in different parts of the United States or those between a Canadian English speaker and a British English speaker.
Furthermore, the same speakers would often be well aware of the differences and might even be able to "standardise" their language or use each other's words to avoid confusion. Even so, there are too many forms to try to form any complete list in this article. However, some of the better-known usages include the following:

The use of septante for "seventy" and nonante for "ninety", in contrast to Standard French soixante-dix (literally "sixty-ten") and quatre-vingt-dix ("four-twenty-ten"). Those former words occur also in Swiss French. Unlike the Swiss, however, Belgians never use huitante for quatre-vingts ("four twenties"), with the use of octante in the local [Brussels](4578) dialect as being the only exception. Although they are considered Belgian and Swiss words, septante and nonante were common in France until around the 16th century, when the newer forms began to dominate.
The words for meals vary, as described in the table below. The usage in Belgian, Swiss and [Canadian French](4370) accords with the etymology: déjeuner comes from a verb meaning "to break the fast". In France, however, breakfast is rendered by petit déjeuner. Souper is used in France to refer instead to a meal taken around midnight.

Many Walloon words and expressions have crept into Belgian French, especially in the eastern regions of Wallonia:
Qu'à torate (similar to à bientôt, "see you soon")
pèkèt ("jenever")
barakî (similar to the word chav in British English).
Qué novel ? (similar to quoi de neuf ?, "what's up ?")
Germanic influences are also visible:
Crolle ("curl") reflects the Brabantic pronunciation of the Dutch word krul. ("Boucle" is used in France.)
S'il vous plaît is used to mean "here" (when someone is handed something) as well as "please", but in France, the meaning is limited to "please", "voilà" is used for "here". That is comparable to the use of alstublieft in Dutch.
Dringuelle (Standard French "pourboire"), "tip", from the Dutch word drinkgeld, but it is less commonly used in [Brussels](4578).
Kot (student room in a dormitory) from Belgian Dutch "kot".
Ring (ring road) from Dutch "ring". In Standard French, the term is "ceinture périphérique" or "périph'".
Savoir (to know) is often used in the place of pouvoir (to be able to). It was quite common, however, in older forms of French.
Blinquer (to shine), instead of briller, has a Germanic origin and passed through Walloon.
Bourgmestre (mayor), instead of maire.

Grammar
The grammar of Belgian French is usually the same as that of France, but Germanic influences can be seen in the following differences:

Ça me goûte, Standard French "ça me plaît", "I like it" (only for food), is a calque of Dutch Dat smaakt: Spanish 'me gusta'.
Tu viens avec ?, Standard French "Tu m'accompagnes?", literally "Are you coming with?" (meaning "Are you coming with me?"), is a calque of Dutch Kom je mee?.
Ça tire ici (used mostly in [Brussels](4578)), for Standard French "Il y a un courant d'air") "There is a draught" is a calque of the Belgian Dutch Het trekt hier (Netherlands Dutch Het tocht hier).
Phrases like pour + V : "Passe-moi un bic pour écrire" (Standard French "Donne-moi un stylo afin que je puisse écrire") "Give me a pen, so that I can write / for me to write" is a grammatical structure found in Dutch ("om te +V").
"Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça pour un animal ?" Standard French "Qu'est-ce que c'est comme animal ?" / "Quelle sorte d'animal c'est ?", "What kind of animal is this?" (literally, "What is that for an animal?"), Dutch "Wat is dat voor (een) dier?" or "Wat voor dier is dat?"
The use of une fois ("once") in mid-sentence, especially in [Brussels](4578), is a direct translation of Dutch "eens". French people who want to imitate the Belgian accent often use a lot of "une fois" at the end of the sentences, often wrongly: "Viens une fois ici, literally from the Dutch "Kom eens hier" ("Come once here"). The English equivalent would be "Could you come here?" or "Why don't you come here?"
Jouer poker ("Standard French "Jouer au poker") "Playing poker" is influenced by the Dutch Poker spelen.
