Apatrapya
Apatrapya (Sanskrit, also apatrƒÅpya; Pali: ottappa; Tibetan Wylie: khrel yod pa) is a Buddhist term translated as "decorum"  or "shame". It is defined as shunning unwholesome actions so as to not be reproached by others of good character.  It is one of the virtuous mental factors within the [Abhidharma](4907) teachings. 
The [Abhidharma](4907)-samuccaya states: 

What is apatrapya? It is to avoid what is objectionable in the eyes of others.
The difference between hri (self-respect) and apatrapya (decorum) is that hri means to refrain from unwholesome actions due to one's own conscience, while apatrapya means to refrain from unwholesome actions to avoid being reproached by others.
