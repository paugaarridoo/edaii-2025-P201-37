Africa Cricket Association
The [Africa](1700) [Cricket](1466) Association (ACA) is an international body which coordinates the development of cricket in [Africa](1700). The ACA was founded in 1997, and has 23 member countries.
The role of the ACA includes promoting the development of cricket in [Africa](1700) and organising some regional tournaments. These have included the ACA [Africa](1700) T20 Cup and the [Africa](1700) Women's Twenty20 Championship. The role of the ACA is complementary to the International [Cricket](1466) Council (ICC), which organises the regional qualifying tournaments for global events.

History
The ACA has its origins in the Zone VI [Cricket](1466) Confederation, which was established in 1991 to coordinate international cricket in Southern [Africa](1700) along the lines of the [Africa](1700)n Zone VI Athletics Championships. The inaugural Zone VI tournament was held in Windhoek in September 1991 with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zambia participating along with the Oxford University [Cricket](1466) Club as guests. The confederation soon secured the support of the United [Cricket](1466) Board of South [Africa](1700) and expanded outside of Southern [Africa](1700), with Uganda joining in 1994 and Kenya joining in 1995. In March 1996, a meeting was held in Johannesburg to discuss the formation of an [Africa](1700)-wide body.
The inaugural annual general meeting of the [Africa](1700) [Cricket](1466) Association (ACA) was held in Harare in August 1997. The last Zone VI tournament was also held in 1997 and replaced by an [Africa](1700) Cup open to countries from all around the continent. Hoosain Ayob was appointed as full-time development director. Peter Chingoka of Zimbabwe was elected chairman of the ACA in 1998, replacing South [Africa](1700)'s Krish Mackerdhuj.
In 2005, the ACA and the Asian [Cricket](1466) Council (ACC) established Afro-Asian [Cricket](1466) Cooperation as a vehicle to promote the Afro-Asia Cup, a series of One Day International (ODI) matches between an [Africa](1700) XI and an Asia XI to raise funds for the development of cricket on both continents. The 2005 Afro-Asia Cup was held in South [Africa](1700) and suffered from low attendance and a lack of interest from the players, although generating significant television revenues. A second tournament was held in India in 2007 but the event was not continued, although several proposals for a revival have been made.
In 2023, the ACA announced a 10-year partnership with Mumbai-based firm Corcom Media Ventures for the organisation, promotion, and broadcasting of ACA tournaments, including the ACA [Africa](1700) T20 Cup and plans for a Women's [Africa](1700) T20 Cup and an [Africa](1700)n Premier League.
