Banana cue
[Banana](2900) cue or bananacue is a popular snack food or street food in the Philippines. It is a portmanteau of banana and barbecue, which in Philippine English refers to meat cooked in a style similar to satay.

Description

It is usually skewered on a bamboo stick, and sold on the streets. The skewer stick is just for ease of serving and eating, but the dish is not cooked on the skewer (as opposed to ginanggang).
