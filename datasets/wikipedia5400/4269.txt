Bavarian language
[Bavaria](1377)n (German: Bairisch ˈbaɪʁɪʃ ; [Bavaria](1377)n: Boarisch, Boirisch), alternately Austro-[Bavaria](1377)n, is a major group of Upper German varieties spoken in the south-east of the German language area, including the German state of [Bavaria](1377), most of [Austria](1585) and the Italian region of South Tyrol. Prior to 1945, [Bavaria](1377)n was also prevalent in parts of the southern Sudetenland and western Hungary. [Bavaria](1377)n is spoken by approximately 12 million people in an area of around 125,000 square kilometres (48,000 sq mi), making it the largest of all German dialects. In 2008, 45 percent of [Bavaria](1377)ns claimed to use only dialect in everyday communication.

Language or dialect
[Bavaria](1377)n is commonly considered to be a dialect of German, but some sources classify it as a separate language: the International Organization for Standardization has assigned a unique ISO 639-3 language code (bar), and the UNESCO lists [Bavaria](1377)n in the Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger since 2009; however, the classification of [Bavaria](1377)n as an individual language has been criticized by some scholars of [Bavaria](1377)n.
Reasons why [Bavaria](1377)n can be viewed as a dialect of German include the perception of its speakers, the lack of standardization, the traditional use of Standard German as a roofing language, the relative closeness to German which does not justify [Bavaria](1377)n to be viewed as an abstand language, or the fact that no country applied for [Bavaria](1377)n to be entered into the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
The difference between [Bavaria](1377)n and Standard German is larger than the difference between Danish and some varieties of Norwegian or between Czech and Slovak.

Origins
History and etymology
The word [Bavaria](1377)n is derived from the name of the people who settled [Bavaria](1377) along with their tribal dialect.  The origin of the word is disputed.  The most common theory traces the word to Bajowarjōz, meaning 'inhabitants of Bojer land'.  In turn, Bojer (Latin: Boii, German: Boier) originated as the name for former Celtic inhabitants of the area, with the name passing to the mixed population of Celts, Romans, and successive waves of German arrivals during the early medieval period.    
The local population eventually established the Duchy of [Bavaria](1377), forming the south-eastern part of the kingdom of Germany. The Old High German documents from the area of [Bavaria](1377) are identified as Altbairisch (Old [Bavaria](1377)n), even though at this early date there were few distinctive features that would divide it from [Alemannic German](4213).
The dialectal separation of Upper German into East Upper German ([Bavaria](1377)n) and West Upper German (Alemannic) became more tangible in the Middle High German period, from about the 12th century.

Geographical distribution and dialects
In Europe:
In Germany, the language is spoken in Upper [Bavaria](1377), Lower [Bavaria](1377), and the Upper Palatinate districts in [Bavaria](1377). It is also spoken in southern Vogtland, in Saxony;
In [Austria](1585), except Vorarlberg and Reutte;
In Italy in South Tyrol and a handful of linguistic enclaves of Cimbrian and Carnic people in Northern Italy;
In Switzerland, it is spoken in the village of Samnaun, in Grisons;
In Sopron (Hungary) and surroundings.
Outside of Europe:
In Treze Tílias, Brazil
In Pozuzo, Peru
In the United States and Canada (Hutterite German)
Three main dialects of [Bavaria](1377)n are:

Northern [Bavaria](1377)n, mainly spoken in Upper Palatinate, but also in adjacent areas (small parts of Upper Franconia (Wunsiedel district and Bayreuth district), Saxony (southern Vogtland), Middle Franconia, Upper [Bavaria](1377) and Lower [Bavaria](1377)).
Central [Bavaria](1377)n along the main rivers Isar and Danube, spoken in Upper [Bavaria](1377) (including Munich, which has a standard German-speaking majority), Lower [Bavaria](1377), southern Upper Palatinate, the Swabian district of Aichach-Friedberg, the northern parts of the State of Salzburg, Upper [Austria](1585), Lower [Austria](1585), Vienna (see Viennese German) and the Northern Burgenland.
Southern [Bavaria](1377)n in Samnaun, Tyrol, South Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria, and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland.
Differences are clearly noticeable within those three subgroups, which in [Austria](1585) often coincide with the borders of the particular states. For example, each of the accents of Carinthia, Styria, and Tyrol can be easily recognised. Also, there is a marked difference between eastern and western central [Bavaria](1377)n, roughly coinciding with the border between [Austria](1585) and [Bavaria](1377). In addition, the Viennese dialect has some characteristics distinguishing it from all other dialects. In Vienna, minor, but recognizable, variations are characteristic for distinct districts of the city.
Before the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, the linguistic border of [Bavaria](1377)n with Czech was on the farther side of the Bohemian Forest and its Bohemian foreland was [Bavaria](1377)n-speaking.
Alternatively, there are four main dialects:

North [Bavaria](1377)n
Middle [Bavaria](1377)n
South Middle [Bavaria](1377)n
South [Bavaria](1377)n

Use
[Bavaria](1377)n differs sufficiently from Standard German to make it difficult for native speakers to adopt standard pronunciation. Educated [Bavaria](1377)ns and [Austria](1585)ns can almost always read, write and understand Standard German, but they may have very little opportunity to speak it, especially in rural areas. In those regions, Standard German is restricted to use as the language of writing and the media. It is therefore often referred to as Schriftdeutsch ("written German") rather than the usual term Hochdeutsch ("High German" or "Standard German"). Given that Central German and Upper German together comprise the High German languages, out of which the then new, written standard was developed and as opposed to Low German, that is an alternative naming many High German dialect speakers regard justified.

School
[Bavaria](1377) and [Austria](1585) officially use Standard German as the primary medium of education. With the spread of universal education, the exposure of speakers of [Bavaria](1377)n to Standard German has been increasing, and many younger people, especially in the region's cities and larger towns, speak Standard German with only a slight accent. This accent usually only exists in families where [Bavaria](1377)n is spoken regularly. Families that do not use [Bavaria](1377)n at home usually use Standard German instead. In [Austria](1585), some parts of grammar and spelling are taught in Standard German lessons.
As reading and writing in [Bavaria](1377)n is generally not taught at schools, almost all literate speakers of the language prefer to use Standard German for writing. Regional authors and literature may play a role in education as well, but by and large, Standard German is the lingua franca.

Literature
Although there exist grammars, vocabularies, and a translation of the Bible in [Bavaria](1377)n, there is no common orthographic standard. Poetry is written in various [Bavaria](1377)n dialects, and many pop songs use the language as well, especially ones belonging to the Austropop wave of the 1970s and 1980s.
Although [Bavaria](1377)n as a spoken language is in daily use in its region, Standard German, often with strong regional influence, is preferred in the mass media.
Ludwig Thoma was a noted German author who wrote works such as Lausbubengeschichten in [Bavaria](1377)n.

Web
There is a [Bavaria](1377)n Wikipedia. Also, the official FC Bayern Munich website was available in [Bavaria](1377)n.

Phonology
Consonants
Notes:

Aspiration may occur among voiceless plosives in word-initial position.
The phoneme /h/ is frequently realised as ç or x word-internally and is realised as h word-initially.
Intervocalic /s/ can be voiced to z, unless it is fortis (lengthened), such as in /hɔasːn/ 'to be named', compared to /rɔasn/ 'to travel', where the sibilant is lenis.
A trill sound /r/ may also be realised as a flap ɾ.
Intervocalic /v/ can be realised as ʋ or β, w.
Some dialects, such as the [Bavaria](1377)n dialect in South Tyrol, realise /k/ as an affricate k͡x word-initially and before /m, n, l, r/, which is an extension of the High German consonant shift to velar consonants.

Vowels
Vowel phonemes in parentheses occur only in certain [Bavaria](1377)n dialects or only appear as allophones or in diphthongs. Nasalization may also be distinguished in some dialects.

[Bavaria](1377)n has an extensive vowel inventory, like most Germanic languages. Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by length or tenseness.

Orthography
Grammar
[Bavaria](1377)n usually has case inflection only for the article. With very few exceptions, nouns are not inflected for case.
The simple past tense is very rare in [Bavaria](1377)n and has been retained for only a few verbs, including 'to be' and 'to want'. In general, the perfect is used to express past time.
[Bavaria](1377)n features verbal inflection for several moods such as indicative, subjunctive, imperative and optative. See the table below for inflection of the [Bavaria](1377)n verb måcha, 'make; do':

Pronouns
Personal pronouns
* These are typically used in the very northern dialects of [Bavaria](1377)n.

Possessive pronouns
The possessive pronouns Deina and Seina inflect in the same manner. Oftentimes, -nige is added to the nominative to form the adjective form of the possessive pronoun, like mei(nige), dei(nige), and the like.

Indefinite pronouns
Just like the possessive pronouns listed above, the indefinite pronouns koana, "none", and oana, "one" are inflected the same way.
There is also the indefinite pronoun ebba(d), "someone" with its impersonal form ebb(a)s, "something". It is inflected in the following way:

Interrogative pronouns
The interrogative pronouns wea, "who", and wås, "what" are inflected the same way the indefinite pronoun ebba is inflected.

Society
[Bavaria](1377)ns produce a variety of nicknames for those who bear traditional [Bavaria](1377)n or German names like Josef, Theresa or Georg (becoming Sepp'l or more commonly Sepp, Resi and Schorsch, respectively). [Bavaria](1377)ns often refer to names with the family name coming first (like da Stoiber Ede instead of Edmund Stoiber). The use of the article is considered mandatory when using this linguistic variation. In addition, nicknames different from the family name exist for almost all families, especially in small villages. They consist largely of their profession, names or professions of deceased inhabitants of their homes or the site where their homes are located. This nickname is called Hausname (en: name of the house) and is seldom used to name the person, but more to state where they come from or live or to whom they are related. Examples of this are:

Mohler (e.g. Maler – painter)
Bachbauer (farmer who lives near a brook/creek)
Moosrees (Theresa (Rees/Resi) who lives near a moss)
Schreiner (joiner/carpenter)
