History
The practice of basketball in [Argentina](1862) was started by Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (Young Men's Christian Association – YMCA) in 1912, with the first Federation (Federación [Argentina](1862)) established to organise competitions not only in Buenos Aires but in several cities around [Argentina](1862).

[Argentina](1862) played its first international game against Uruguay in 1921.
In 1950 [Argentina](1862) won its first and only World Championship to date, with a squad formed entirely of amateur players, after defeating France (twice), Brazil, Chile, Egypt and the [United States](1100) in the decisive match.
With the creation of the Liga Nacional de Básquet in the mid-1980s, a new generation of players led [Argentina](1862) to a moderate success in the 1986 World Championship where the squad defeated [United States](1100) for the first time.
2001 was the year when the Golden Generation, winning [Argentina](1862)'s first FIBA Americas Championship – held in Neuquen – where they defeated all of their rivals in the competition. The progress of Argentine basketball would be shown in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, where they became the first team to defeat a [United States](1100) roster composed entirely of NBA players and also reached the final, finally losing to Yugoslavia. [Argentina](1862) would reach the finals for the first time since the first World Championship in 1950, but the most important achievement for the squad came in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens when [Argentina](1862) won their first gold medal, including another victory over the [United States](1100) at the semi-finals. The Olympics title in 2004 was the highest honor and most important title won in Argentine basketball history.

Uniforms and suppliers
Since its establishment, the [Argentina](1862) national team had worn white kits. The team had a long tenure wearing Topper, which was the official supplier since the 1970s to 2007. In 2002, two light blue horizontal stripes (similar to the National flag) were added to the jerseys. When the contract with Topper expired in 2007, the CABB signed an agreement with Chinese firm Li-Ning, which kept the design established by Topper.
Italian company Kappa was the uniforms supplier since 2013.
In 2014 the company designed a vertical striped model in the style of football and field hockey representatives. The jersey debuted in the [2014 FIBA [Basketball](2400) World Cup](2416). When Nike became official sponsor through its brand [Air Jordan](2438), the [Argentina](1862) jersey returned to a simple white color scheme. The deal extended to 2020, when the American company ceased operations in [Argentina](1862).
Starting in 2022, Spanish Kelme is the current kit provider for all the [Argentina](1862) basketball teams.
