Charles William Mitchell
Charles William Mitchell (1854â€“1903) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle. A contemporary of John William Waterhouse, his work is similar in many ways. His one famous piece was [Hypatia](3801), shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the [Charles Kingsley](3898) serialized novel [Hypatia](3801), or New Foes with an Old Face.  This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery.
