2030 Mediterranean Games
The 2030 Mediterranean Games (Albanian: Lojërat Mesdhetare 2030; Serbian: Медитеранске игре 2030, romanized: Mediteranske igre 2030), officially known as the XXI Mediterranean Games, and commonly known as Prishtina 2030, is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to be held from 24 July to 4 August 2030 in Pristina, Kosovo.

Bidding process
The International Committee of Mediterranean Games launched the bidding process for the 2030 games at a meeting of its executive committee held on 10 December 2022 in Pristina, Kosovo. In April 2023, the International Committee of Mediterranean Games (CIJM) announced the end of the candidature process and the sole candidate city, Pristina, for the 2030 Games. Pristina was confirmed as host city on 8 September 2023 during the ICMG General Assembly with 55 votes in favour, eight against and three abstentions.

Candidate cities
Pristina, Kosovo - CIJM president Davide Tizzano stated that "Kosovo, together with the neighbouring countries will be ready to organise the Mediterranean Games" following a meeting with the President of Kosovo, Vjosa Osmani in December 2022. On 4 April 2023, the Prime Minister of Kosovo Albin Kurti, announced that Kosovo has officially applied to host the 2030 Mediterranean Games in Pristina. Kurti also stated that as Kosovo is a landlocked country, is expected that the beach sports will be held in neighbouring Albania. Pristina was officially confirmed as a candidate city by the CIJM on 1 April 2023. The formal host selection took place on 8 September 2023. Prishtina's bid was led by the Secretary General of the Kosovo Olympic Committee, Besim Aliti. This will be the first time that the event is held in a landlocked country. Additionally, it will mark the second instance of the Mediterranean Games being organized in a city without access to the Mediterranean Sea, following the [1983 Mediterranean Games](1041)  held in Casablanca, Morocco. Additionally, it would be the second time that these games are organized in the Western Balkans, following the [1979 Mediterranean Games](1037) in Split in what was then Yugoslavia.

Development and preparation
Marketing
The emblem for the games bid was designed by Arian Hoti of the media productions organisation TEMA based in Ferizaj. The official promotional video for the games, featuring the motto "This is how we do it!", was released in November 2023.

Venues
Kosovo prime minister Albin Kurti has stated that a new national stadium, swimming pool complex, tennis stadium and shooting range will be built for the games. Five temporary venues are to be built and existing facilities such as the Palace of Youth and Sports will be renovated.
In addition to Pristina, events will also take place in cities across Kosovo such as Ferizaj, Gjakova, Mitrovica, Peja, Podujevo and Prizren. As Kosovo is a landlocked country, sailing and other events will take place in Durrës, in neighbouring Albania.
