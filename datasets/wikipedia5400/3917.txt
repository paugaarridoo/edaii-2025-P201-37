Madrid Chamartín railway station
The Estación de [Madrid](3916)-Chamartín Clara Campoamor or [Madrid](3916) Chamartín tʃamaɾˈtin is the second major railway station in [Madrid](3916), Spain. Located on the northern side of the city, it was built between 1970 and 1975, but more work was carried on into the early 1980s. It then superseded Atocha station, which is located just south of the city centre. However, as the [AVE](1091) network expanded with a hub at Atocha, Chamartin again became [Madrid](3916)'s second station by passenger volume.
It hosts the railway networks connecting [Madrid](3916) and north-western Spain, the [AVE](1091) (high-speed line) from [Madrid](3916) to Segovia, Valladolid and León and many Cercanías lines (commuter rail), as well as the international line to Lisbon. There are also connections with Atocha. Since July, 2022 both stations are connected by a direct tunnel.  Under the railway station is Chamartín Metro Station, linking with lines 1 and 10 of the [Madrid](3916) Metro, also for travelling to [Madrid](3916) City Centre.
Since September, 2022 Chamartin also holds the East and South East high speed lines that connect [Madrid](3916) with Murcia and Valencian Community.
