ABA Club Championship
The ABA Club Championship was an [Asia](1914)n basketball tournament for professional clubs, organised by the [Asia](1914)n [Basketball](2400) Association (ABA) under Dr. Carl Men Ky Ching. The ABA is not to be confused with FIBA [Asia](1914) which Dr. Ching had also once presided. The tournament was first held in 1992. It was named [Asia](1914)n [Basketball](2400) Super League from 1999 to 2001, and came to a climax in 2000. The tournament was suspended between 2002 and 2006, and has been held annually in [China](2217) between 2007 and 2013. Unlike the FIBA [Asia](1914) Champions Cup of today, most of ABA Club Championship's participants were from the Far East.
