Argentine Pila
The Argentine Pila or Perro Pila Argentino is an Argentine breed of hairless dog. It was recognised by the Asociaci√≥n Canina Argentina in 2007. It forms part of the large group of South American hairless breeds and types, but is distinct from other modern breeds such as the Chinese Crested, the Peruvian Hairless and the Xoloitzcuintle. It is generally dark-skinned, or light-skinned with dark spots.
It is estimated that approximately 1,700 of these dogs are in Argentina, predominantly in the Salta province in the north of the country.
