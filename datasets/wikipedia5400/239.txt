Ariège Pointer
The Ariège Pointer is a French breed of hunting dog of pointer type. It originates in the Ariège département of Occitanie, in south-western France. The breed name may be rendered in English as Ariège Pointing Dog or Braque de l'Ariège.

Overview
The dog type used by hunters in the Ariège département of Occitanie was said to be descended from dogs that were crosses of the Perdiguero de Burgos and the Bracco Italiano. 
The population decreased over World War I and II, and in 1990 a team of breeders decided to devote themselves to the Braque de l'Ariège's survival, in particular Alain Deteix. He headed that team of breeders and devoted himself to the revival of the breed.
It is well suited to hunting wild hare and partridge.

Appearance
The Braque de l'Ariège is a normally proportioned dog with drop ears. The tail is traditionally docked. The coat is short and primarily white, speckled with larger patches of colours described as orange, liver, or chestnut on the head and ears. Size is about 60–67 centimetres (24–26 in) in height at the withers. Dogs of the breed should appear powerful but without excessive heaviness, robust and of strong. It is quick, energetic, and very independent, and so needs regular training and activity.
