Against Political Equality
Against Political Equality: The Confucian Case is a 2019 book by Tongdong Bai in which the author advocates a domestic governance that is influenced by [Confucianism](4901), possessing both meritocratic characteristics and democratic elements. Bai argues that egalitarianism and its analogous system of liberal democracy sometimes conflict with good governance and the protection of liberties, and that restriction of democracy is necessary for preservation of liberty.

Reception
In Financial Times, Rana Mitter billed Against Political Equality as a "powerful and lively contribution to a major debate that has a long way to go."
