Alabama State University
[Alabama](1145) State University (ASU, Bama State, or [Alabama](1145) State) is a public historically black university in Montgomery, [Alabama](1145). Founded in 1867, during the Reconstruction era, it was one of about 180 "normal schools" established by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools.  It was one of 23 established to train African Americans to teach in segregated schools. Some of the 180 closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century.  ASU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

History
[Alabama](1145) State University was founded in 1867 as the Lincoln Normal School of Marion in Marion. In December 1874, the State Board accepted the transfer of title to the school after a legislative act was passed authorizing the state to fund a Normal School, and George N. Card was named president. Thus, in 1874, this predecessor of [Alabama](1145) State University became America's first state-supported educational institution for blacks. This began ASU's history as a "teachers' college."
The second president, William Burns Paterson, was appointed in 1878. He is honored as a founder of [Alabama](1145) State University and was the president for 37 of the school's first 48 years. Paterson was instrumental in the move from Marion to Montgomery in 1887.
In 1887, the university opened in its new location in Montgomery, but an [Alabama](1145) State Supreme Court ruling forced the school to change its name; it was renamed the Normal School for Colored Students. The campus was chosen in 1889 although preparing the buildings at the site took a while longer.
In the decades that followed, Lincoln Normal School became a junior college, and in 1928 became a full four-year institution. In 1929 it became State Teachers College, [Alabama](1145) State College for Negroes in 1948, and [Alabama](1145) State College in 1954. In 1969, the State Board of Education, then the governing body of the university, approved a name change; the institution became [Alabama](1145) State University.
The 1995 Knight vs. [Alabama](1145) remedial decree transformed ASU into a comprehensive regional institution paving the way for two new undergraduate programs, four new graduate programs, diversity scholarship funding and endowment, funding to build a state-of-the art health sciences facility, and a facility renewal allocation to refurbish three existing buildings.
WVAS-FM was launched on June 15, 1984, beaming 25,000 watts of power from the fifth floor of the Levi Watkins Learning Center for two years before moving to its current location at Thomas Kilby Hall. Today, WVAS has grown to 80,000 watts and has a listenership that spans 18 counties, reaching a total population of more than 651,000. In recent years, the station has also begun streaming its broadcast via the Web, connecting a global audience to the university.
The early 1990s witnessed the beginning of WAPR-FM ([Alabama](1145) Public Radio), which [Alabama](1145) State University and Troy University, both of which already held station licenses of their own, cooperated with the University of [Alabama](1145) in building and operating. WAPR-FM 88.3—Selma's signal reaches the region known colloquially as the Black Belt, about 13 counties in the west central and central parts of [Alabama](1145), including the city of Montgomery.
In 2021, ASU received a $24.7 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Education to help Montgomery Public Schools students better prepare for a higher education.  This is the largest single grant in the history of the institution.

ASU undergraduate students who successfully complete the program will receive a STEM related bachelor's degree from ASU and an engineering bachelor's degree from Auburn or UAB in approximately five years.
