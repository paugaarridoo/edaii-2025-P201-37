History
The tournament's host team, the senior men's Greek National [Basketball](2400) Team, has won the tournament 18 times so far, last one 2022. In 1991, the Hellenic [Basketball](2400) Federation and FIBA Europe, joined together to hold the special edition 1991 FIBA Centennial Jubilee, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the sport of basketball. The Centennial Jubilee Tournament is not counted with the other Acropolis Tournaments, because it was not solely organized by the Hellenic [Basketball](2400) Federation.
To date, there have been 32 official Acropolis Tournaments that have been organized by the Hellenic [Basketball](2400) Federation, plus the unofficial special edition 1991 FIBA Centennial Jubilee. The Greek national team did not host the 2012 Acropolis Tournament, because it participated in the 2012 FIBA World Olympic qualifying tournament, and failed to qualify for the Olympics that year. There was also no Acropolis Tournament in the years 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020.
