African-American Muslims
[African-American](1752) Muslims, also known as Black Muslims, are an [African-American](1752) religious minority. [African-American](1752) Muslims account for over 20% of American Muslims. They represent one of the larger Muslim populations of the [United States](1100) as there is no ethnic group that makes up the majority of American Muslims. They mostly belong to the Sunni sect, but smaller Shia and Nation of [Islam](5101) minorities also exist. The history of [African-American](1752) Muslims is related to [African-American](1752) history in general, and goes back to the Revolutionary and Antebellum eras.

History
Historically, an estimated 30% of slaves brought to the Americas from West/Central Africa were Muslims. They were overwhelmingly literate in contrast to other slaves, and thus were given supervisory roles. Most of these captives were forced into Christianity during the era of American slavery; however, there are records of individuals such as Omar ibn Said practicing [Islam](5101) for the rest of their lives in the [United States](1100). During the twentieth century, some [African Americans](1132) converted to [Islam](5101), mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive [Islam](5101)ic practices including the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded in 1913, and the Nation of [Islam](5101), founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963. Prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali. [Ahmadiyya](4837) Muslim groups also sought and won converts among [African Americans](1132) in the 1920s and 1930s.
Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among [African Americans](1132) towards mainstream [Islam](5101), after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1975, Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad took control of the Nation after his father's death and guided the majority of its members towards mainstream Sunni [Islam](5101). However, a few members rejected these changes, leading Louis Farrakhan to revive the Nation of [Islam](5101) in 1978 based largely on the ideals of its founder, Wallace Fard Muhammad.

Early American Muslims
Bilali Muhammad
Bilali Mohammed was an enslaved West African on a plantation on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Born in Timbo, Guinea between 1760 and 1779 to a well-educated African Muslim family. Renowned for his Knowledge of [Islam](5101), literacy, and being more educated than his slaveowners. Bilali was the leader and imam of a community of enslaved people, where he lived with his multiple wives and many children. He is best known for his handwritten, [Arabic](4233) manuscript on West African fiqh ([Islam](5101)ic jurisprudence). The 19th century manuscript detailed [Islam](5101)ic beliefs and the rules for ablution, morning prayer, and the calls to prayer. In the 1940s it was taken to Nigeria to be translated by Hausa scholars. Today the manuscript has become one of the most sacred [Islam](5101)ic documents to African American Muslims. Bilali has many living descendants.

Demographics
[African-American](1752) Muslims constitute 20% of the total U.S. Muslim population. Despite this, 2% of Black Americans are Muslim (most adhere to various sects of Christianity, particularly Protestantism).
The majority are Sunni Muslims; a substantial proportion of these identify under the community of W. Deen Mohammed. Cities with large concentration of [African-American](1752) Muslims include Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Newark, Washington. D.C., Philadelphia, and Atlanta. The Nation of [Islam](5101) led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 members.

Sects
During the first half of the 20th century, a small number of [African Americans](1132) established groups based on [Islam](5101)ic and Gnostic teachings. The first of these groups was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Timothy Drew (Drew Ali) in 1913. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to [Islam](5101) of their Moorish ancestry.

Sunni [Islam](5101)
Sunni is a term derived from sunnah (سُنَّة /ˈsunna/, plural سُنَن sunan /ˈsunan/) meaning "habit", "usual practice", "custom", "tradition". The Muslim use of this term refers to the sayings and living habits of Muhammad. Its adherents are referred to in [Arabic](4233) as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jamāʻah ("the people of the sunnah and the community") or ahl as-sunnah for short. In English, its adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah. Sunni [Islam](5101) is sometimes referred to as "orthodox [Islam](5101)". The Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah) and binding juristic consensus form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni [Islam](5101). Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources, in conjunction with analogical reasoning, consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion, using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools.
The conversion of Malik el-Shabazz (better known as Malcolm X) in 1964 is widely regarded as the turning point for the spread of orthodox Sunni [Islam](5101) among Black American Muslims. Encouraged to learn about Sunni [Islam](5101) after his departure from the Nation of [Islam](5101), he converted; others from the Nation of [Islam](5101) soon followed. Warith Deen Mohammed rose to leadership of the Nation of [Islam](5101) in 1975 following the death of his father Elijah Muhammad and began the groundbreaking, though sometimes controversial, process of leading Black Muslims out of the NOI and into Sunni [Islam](5101). As a result of his personal thinking and studies of the Quran, he became part of Ahlus Sunnah during a term in federal prison from 1961 to 1963 for refusing induction into the [United States](1100) military.
Mohammed introduced many reforms and began an information campaign about Sunni [Islam](5101) much as el-Shabazz had years earlier. He stated that Fard was not divine and that his father was not a prophet. All of the over 400 temples were converted into traditional [Islam](5101)ic mosques, and he introduced the Five Pillars of [Islam](5101) to his followers. He rejected literal interpretations of his father's theology and Black-separatist views and on the basis of his intensive independent study of [Islam](5101)ic law, history, and theology, he accepted whites as fellow worshipers. However, he also encouraged [African Americans](1132) to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon them to change their surnames which were often given to their ancestors by slave masters. He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Hispanic and Latino American Muslims. By 1978 he had succeeded in leading the majority of the original NOI to Sunni [Islam](5101) which still stands as the largest mass conversion to [Islam](5101) in the [United States](1100). In many urban areas of the [United States](1100) today many Black Muslims in the Sunni tradition are known and recognized by the hijabs on women and kufi caps and long beards for men. These beards are grown as an adherence to the Sunnah of Muhammad for men to let their beards grow. Commonly called Sunnah beards, and Sunni Beards, among Muslims and more recently known as Philly beards have also gained popularity among non Muslim men emulating Muslim style.

Shia [Islam](5101)
During the Muslim movement in the [United States](1100) during the 20th century, the African American community was also introduced to Shia [Islam](5101). The majority of African American in that time were not aware of the Sunni-Shia divide, although most became Sunni due to how it was more widespread, a lack of access to Shia learning materials, as well as the stigma associated with Shia [Islam](5101). The 1979 Iranian Revolution gave Shia Muslims a voice within the Muslim community. This was the time when [African Americans](1132) were first exposed to Shia [Islam](5101), and by 1982, more than one thousand [African Americans](1132) had accepted Shia [Islam](5101) in Philadelphia alone. Many Salafi and Wahhabi preachers were unhappy about the growth of Shia [Islam](5101), and began telling African American Muslims that it was disbelief, which alienated African American Shias from their community. African American Sunnis, encouraged by Sunni extremist missionaries, often attacked African American Shias in prisons.
A popular African American Shia preacher is Amir Hakeem, who joined the Nation of [Islam](5101) in prison and later converted to Shia [Islam](5101) before being released. Hakeem became an assistant at a mosque in Watts and hosts charity work as well as teaching gang members in Los Angeles about Shia [Islam](5101). He stated that the Shia community of Watts is predominantly [African Americans](1132).
Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of Malcolm X, also converted to Shia [Islam](5101) and had died as a Shia Muslim.

Moorish Science Temple of America
The Moorish Science Temple of America (MSTA) is an American organization founded in 1913 by self-proclaimed prophet Noble Drew Ali. Born in 1886 in North Carolina, Ali claimed to be returning [African-American](1752)s to the creed and principles of their ancestral religion, [Islam](5101). The tradition is not, however, historically connected to mainstream [Islam](5101); instead, it emerged independently in the [United States](1100) with inspiration from the Muslim tradition. Ali's teachings aligned with Sufi ideas regarding the higher self and the lower self; they also drew heavily from elements of [Buddhism](5001), Christianity, Gnosticism, and Taoism.  The MSTA can be distinguished from mainstream [Islam](5101) by its strongly [African-American](1752) demography, by its emphasis on Iman, or creed, as opposed to mainstream [Islam](5101)'s Five Pillars, by its significant divergences from mainstream [Islam](5101)ic moral and ritual practice, and by its association with black nationalism. These distinctives make its classification as an [Islam](5101)ic denomination a matter of debate among both Muslims and scholars of religion.
Another significant element of the MSTA's teaching is that [African-American](1752)s are actually "descendants of the ancient Moabites whom sic inhabited the North Western and South Western shores of Africa." Specifically, they hold that the Moabites' Iberian Moorish descendants, recently defeated by European powers in the Spanish Reconquista, were prevalent among the victims of the [Atlantic slave trade](1583), making them ancestors of modern [African Americans](1132). MSTA adherents also believe that the Negroid Asiatic was the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. While these assertions about African American origins, Moorish history, and American history are not consistent with the conclusions of historical research, adherants refer to themselves as "Asiatics" in their religious texts and call themselves "indigenous Moors", "American Moors" or "Moorish Americans" rather than, or in contradistinction to "African Moors" or "[African Americans](1132)."

Nation of [Islam](5101)
The Nation of [Islam](5101) (NOI) was created in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: "[Allah](5160) is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth".
In 1934 Elijah Muhammad became the leader of the NOI. He deified Fard, saying that he was an incarnation of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were Malcolm X, who became the face of the NOI in the media, and Muhammad Ali, who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory. Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims.
Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a controversial comment on the John F. Kennedy assassination), and proceeded to form Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity before his pilgrimage to Mecca and conversion to Sunni [Islam](5101). He is viewed as the first person to start the movement among [African Americans](1132) towards Sunni [Islam](5101).
Muhammad died in 1975 and his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, became the leader of the Nation of [Islam](5101). He led the organization toward Sunni [Islam](5101) and renamed it the World Community of [Islam](5101) in the West the following year. Louis Farrakhan, who quit Warith Deen Mohammed's group, started an organization along the lines of Elijah Muhammad's teachings. Farrakhan renamed his organization the Nation of [Islam](5101) in 1981, and has regained many properties associated with Elijah Muhammad, such as Mosque Maryam, its Chicago headquarters.
It was estimated that the Nation of [Islam](5101) had at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility.
The Nation of [Islam](5101) has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Conversion to orthodox Sunni [Islam](5101)
After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-[Islam](5101) in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time.
W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni [Islam](5101). He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire "temple" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the salat, to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca.
A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of [Islam](5101) under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader.

Five-Percent Nation
The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the "Nation of Gods and Earths" (NGE/NOGE) or the "Five Percenters", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of [Islam](5101) named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as "[Allah](5160) the Father"). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of [Islam](5101) after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was [Allah](5160) and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified.
Members of the group call themselves [Allah](5160)'s Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest.

United Nation of [Islam](5101)
The United Nation of [Islam](5101) (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself "Royall, [Allah](5160) in Person".

[Ahmadiyya](4837)
Although at first the [Ahmadiyya](4837) Muslim Community's efforts were broadly spread out over a large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination in the US made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly [African Americans](1132) and the Muslim immigrant community. Ahmadis often became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. In recent times, many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan as refugees due to persecution; this has brought a small second wave of Ahmadis to the [United States](1100).

Prison conversions to [Islam](5101)
Conversion to [Islam](5101) is a practice which is common to [African-American](1752)s in prison. J. Michael Waller found that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. According to him, 80% of the prisoners who "find faith" while in prison convert to [Islam](5101). These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside [Islam](5101)ist groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests.
