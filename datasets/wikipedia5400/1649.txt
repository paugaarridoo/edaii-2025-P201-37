Area and population of European countries
This is a list of countries and territories in Europe by population density. Data are from the United Nations unless otherwise specified.
[Abkhazia](1520), Georgia and South Ossetia are each bordered on the north by the Greater Caucasus, and may have some territory north of these mountains and thus in Europe by the most common definition. These three, as well as [Armenia](1567) and [Azerbaijan](1588) would have more territory or all of their territory in Europe using a more expansive definition.
Some countries in the Caucasus, as well as Greenland and the geopolitical subdivisions of the island of Cyprus ([Akrotiri and Dhekelia](1531), Cyprus and Northern Cyprus) are not considered geographically European, but are listed here because of their cultural connections to the continent.
There is some discussion about whether Kosovo should be recognised as a separate country. De facto it can be considered as one, but de jure recognition is not clear-cut.
