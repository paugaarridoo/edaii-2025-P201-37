Av (month)
Av (also Menachem Av, Hebrew: אָב, Modern: ʾAv, Tiberian: ʾĀḇ) is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. It is a month of 30 days, and usually occurs in July–August on the Gregorian calendar.
The Babylonian Talmud states that "when we enter the month of Av, our joy is diminished". This is because the darkest events in Jewish history occurred during the first week and a half of this month, particularly the Nine Days which culminate in Tisha B'Av, the 9th day of Av. However, the month also contains a holiday called Tu B'Av which was, in ancient times, considered one of the happiest days of the year.

Etymology
Originally Abu on the Babylonian calendar, the name is derived from Akkadian ʾAbū, which might mean "reed" or be connected to the name of the Mesopotamian god Abu. Others derive the name of the month from the Hebrew word "Av" - "father". The name Ab (Arabic: آﺏ) also appears in the [Arabic language](1644) for the month of August in the Levant (see Arabic names of calendar months).
The name Ab appears in Aramaic ostraca from the Persian period, in Aramaic documents from Ancient Egypt and Palmyra, in Masada and Qarnayim ostraca, in the best manuscripts of Targum Jonathan to Ez. 20:1, and in Rabbinic literature starting with Megillat Taanit. It is one of several months which are not named in the Hebrew Bible.
