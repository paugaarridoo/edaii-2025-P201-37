Research
From 1983 to 1984, Michaels was involved in a project about the initiation rites in Nepal in collaboration with the German Research Foundation. A further project in Nepal between 1984 and 1991 focused on rituals at the Pashupatinatha-Temple. From 1998 to 2002, Axel Michaels was engaged in the project “Text and Context of the Mahima-Dharma-Movement in Orissa”. This project was followed by a research on religious and divine maps of Benares (1999-2003). Both projects were supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG).  In 2002 he started a project in co-operation with Niels Gutschow which examined life cycle rituals in Nepal.  Connected to the project was the shooting and production of the films Handling Death (2005) and Belfruit and loincloth (2007), realized in collaboration with Niels Gutschow and Christian Bau. Later, he also worked on a project aiming at the translation and publication of the so called “Wright-chronicle”, which was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG, 2011 to 2012). Currently, he is working on two research projects. The first project started in 2014, called “Religious and Legal Documents of Pre-modern Nepal”, and aims at a publication and a digital database of religious and legal documents and texts from pre-modern Nepal. The second, the “Nepal Heritage Documentation Project” is a co-operation with Christiane Brosius and started in 2018.
