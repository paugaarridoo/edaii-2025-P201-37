Andrew B. Cooke House
The Andrew B. Cooke House in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was designed in 1953 and completed in 1959 for Andrew B. & Maude Cooke. Along with the Pope-Leighey House and the Luis Marden House, it is one of three [Frank Lloyd Wright](3201) designs in Virginia. A variation of Wright's solar hemicycle designs, the Cooke House features yellow-gold brick and a copper, cantilevered roof.
In 1983, the original owners sold the house to Daniel and Jane Duhl. The Duhls sold the home for US$2.2 million in 2016 to an unnamed buyer.
