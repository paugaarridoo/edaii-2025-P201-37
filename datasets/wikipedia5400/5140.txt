Al-Ghayb
Al-Ghayb ([Arabic](4233): الغيب) is an [Arabic](4233) expression used to convey that something is concealed (unseen). It is an important concept in Islam, encompassing what cannot be perceived or known by humans. This includes God, the attributes of God, the Last Day and its events, and the heart (qalb). Beyond the theological implications, it can also mean something "unseen" relative to an observer, in the sense that someone acts behind the perceiver's back.
In general, creatures classified as supernatural in Western scholarship, such as Jinn, are not considered to be part of al-Ghayb.
In the Quran it has 6 forms and 3 meanings. But it can also be used in a general sense to refer to something that is known to some but concealed from others.

Meaning
In [Arabic](4233), al- Ghayb refers to anything that is hidden in some manner. The term is composed of two words (a definitive article and an adjective), "al" and " Ghayb", literally translating to "the" and "unseen" respectively. It possesses multiple intricate meanings stemming out from the figurative translation "the depth of the well." Given that the bottom of the well is visually concealed as a result of its depth, its contents are generally undeterminable. Al- Ghayb therefore refers to that which is absent, hidden, or concealed.  Like majority of adjectives in the [Arabic](4233) language, al- Ghayb has a triliteral or triconsonantal root. It is composed of three root letters غ ي ب (gaain, yaa, baa), roughly tantamount to gh-y-b respectively in the English language.

In Islam
In the Islamic context, al- Ghayb refers to transcendental or divine secrets. It is mentioned in sixty different places in the Qur'an, in six different forms. It has three primary meanings:

Absent – "That is so al-'Azeez will know that I did not betray him in his absence and that [Allah](5160) does not guide the plan of betrayers."   (12:52)
The unknown or hidden – "[Allah](5160) is Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, the Exalted."  (13:9)
The future – "Say, "I hold not for myself the power of benefit or harm, except what [Allah](5160) has willed. And if I knew the unseen, I could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have touched me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe." "   (7:188)

Types
There are two types of  Ghayb:
1.  Al- Ghayb al-Mutlaq ([Arabic](4233): الغيب المطلق) - Absolute  Ghayb refers to all knowledge that is unseen or concealed and is only known to [Allah](5160).  As stated in the Quran: "And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He…"   (6:59)   

Examples of this form of  Ghayb are illustrated in the narrations of Muhammad: It is narrated that Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of [Allah](5160) said, "The Keys of the  Ghayb (unseen knowledge) are five, nobody knows them but [Allah](5160). Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow except [Allah](5160); nobody knows what is in the womb except [Allah](5160); nobody knows when it will rain except [Allah](5160); no soul knows at what place he will die except [Allah](5160); and nobody knows when the (Final) Hour will begin except [Allah](5160).) 
2.  Al- Ghayb al-Nisbi ([Arabic](4233): الغيب النسبي) - Relative  Ghayb is proportionate to an individual and their situation; hence it is apparent to some while hidden from others. An example to illustrate this notion is that of a class in which the students can see the lecturer, hear the content of the lecture, and the conversations that take place in the classroom, while those outside are unaware of the occurrences in the classroom.

Examples in Islamic texts
In Islamic context, (al-) Ghayb is (the) unseen and unknown, in reference to God ([Allah](5160)) and the forces that shape the world. The Quran states that man (mankind) is unable to see God and his attributes. [Belief](5074) in al- Ghayb is considered an important Muslim characteristic, as it allows for prayer and faith.
