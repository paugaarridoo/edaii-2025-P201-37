Adar
Adar (Hebrew: אֲדָר‎, ʾĂdār; from Akkadian adaru) is the sixth month of the civil year and the twelfth month of the religious year on the Hebrew calendar, roughly corresponding to the month of March in the Gregorian calendar. It is a month of 29 days.

Names and leap years
The month's name, like all the others from the Hebrew calendar, was adopted during the [Babylonian captivity](5261). In the Babylonian calendar the name was Araḫ Addaru or Adār ('Month of Adar').
In leap years, it is preceded by a 30-day intercalary month named Adar Aleph (Hebrew: אדר א׳‎, Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet), also known as "Adar Rishon" (First Adar) or "Adar I", and it is then itself called Adar Bet (Hebrew: אדר ב׳‎, Bet being the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet), also known as Adar Sheni (Second Adar or "Adar II"). Occasionally instead of Adar I and Adar II, "Adar" and "Ve'Adar" are used (Ve means 'and' thus: And-Adar). Adar I and II occur during February–March on the Gregorian calendar.
Sources disagree as to which of the two Adar months is the "real" Adar, and which is the added leap month.

Customs
During the Second Temple period, there was a Jewish custom to make a public proclamation on the first day of the lunar month Adar, reminding the people that they are to prepare their annual monetary offering to the Temple treasury, known as the half-Shekel.
Based on a line in the Mishnah declaring that Purim must be celebrated in Adar II in a leap year (Megillah 1:4), Adar I is considered the "extra" month.  As a result, someone born in Adar during a non leap year would celebrate their birthday in Adar II during a leap year. However, someone born during either Adar in a leap year will celebrate their birthday during Adar in a non-leap year, except that someone born on 30 Adar I will celebrate their birthday on 1 Nisan in a non-leap year because Adar in a non-leap year has only 29 days.
