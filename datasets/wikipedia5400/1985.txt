Eastern Europe
Eastern [Europe](1994) is a subregion of the [Europe](1994)an continent. As a largely ambiguous term, it has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic connotations. Its eastern boundary is marked by the Ural Mountains, whilst its western boundary is defined in various ways. Most definitions include the countries of [Belarus](1683), Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania while less restrictive definitions may also include some or all of the Balkans, the [Baltic states](1669), the Caucasus, and the Visegrád group. 
The region represents a significant part of [Europe](1994)an culture; the main socio-cultural characteristics of Eastern [Europe](1994) have historically been defined by the traditions of the East Slavs and Greeks, as well as by the influence of Eastern Christianity as it developed through the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Another definition was created by the Cold War, as [Europe](1994) was ideologically divided by the Iron Curtain, with "Eastern [Europe](1994)" being synonymous with communist states constituting the Eastern Bloc under the influence of the Soviet Union.
The term is sometimes considered to be pejorative, through stereotypes about Eastern [Europe](1994) being inferior (poorer, less developed) to Western [Europe](1994); the term Central and Eastern [Europe](1994) is sometimes used for a more neutral grouping.

Definitions
Several definitions of Eastern [Europe](1994) exist in the early 21st century, but they often lack precision and may be anachronistic. These definitions are debated across cultures and among experts, even political scientists, as the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. It has also been described as a "fuzzy" term, as the idea itself of Eastern [Europe](1994) is in constant redefinition. The solidification of the idea of an "Eastern [Europe](1994)" dates back chiefly to the (French) Enlightenment.
There are "almost as many definitions of Eastern [Europe](1994) as there are scholars of the region". A related United Nations paper adds that "every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct".

Geographical
While the eastern geographical boundaries of [Europe](1994) are well defined, the boundary between Eastern and Western [Europe](1994) is not geographical but historical, religious and cultural, and is harder to designate.
The Ural Mountains, Ural River, and the Caucasus Mountains are the geographical land border of the eastern edge of [Europe](1994). E.g. Kazakhstan, which is mainly located in Central [Asia](1914) with the most western parts of it located west of the Ural River, also shares a part of Eastern [Europe](1994).
In the west, however, the historical and cultural boundaries of "Eastern [Europe](1994)" are subject to some overlap and, most importantly, have undergone historical fluctuations, which makes a precise definition of the western geographic boundaries of Eastern [Europe](1994) and the geographical midpoint of [Europe](1994) somewhat difficult.

Religious and cultural influence
After the East–West Schism of 1054, significant parts of Eastern [Europe](1994) developed cultural unity and resistance to Catholic Western and Central [Europe](1994) within the framework of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Church Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.
The earliest concept of [Europe](1994) as a cultural sphere (instead of simply a geographic term) was formed by Alcuin of York during the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century, limited to the territories that practised Western Christianity at the time. "[Europe](1994)an" as a cultural term did not include many of the territories under the influence of Eastern Christianity until the early nineteenth century.
A large section of Eastern [Europe](1994) is formed by countries with dominant Orthodox churches, like [Belarus](1683), Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine, for instance, as well as [Armenia](1567), which is predominantly [Armenia](1567)n Apostolic. The Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern [Europe](1994).  To a lesser degree, forms of Eastern Protestantism and Eastern Catholicism have also been influential in Eastern [Europe](1994). Countries where Eastern Protestantism or Eastern Catholicism hold historical significance include [Belarus](1683), Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.

The schism refers to the historical break of communion and theology between the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches. Later developments meant that the divide was no longer solely between Catholic and Orthodox churches. From the 16th century, both Western and Eastern forms of Protestantism began to emerge in [Europe](1994). Additionally, Eastern Catholic Churches began to spread in [Europe](1994) during the 16th and 17th centuries, following the establishment of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in 1596. However, the concept of Eastern Catholicism itself predates this.

Since the Great Schism of 1054, [Europe](1994) has been divided between Catholic (and later additionally Protestant) churches in the West, and the Eastern Orthodox Christian (often incorrectly labelled "Greek Orthodox") churches in the east. Due to this religious cleavage, Eastern Orthodox countries are often associated with Eastern [Europe](1994). A cleavage of this sort is, however, often problematic; for example, Greece is overwhelmingly Orthodox, but is very rarely included in "Eastern [Europe](1994)", for a variety of reasons, the most prominent being that Greece's history, for the most part, was more influenced by Mediterranean cultures and dynamics.

Cold War (1947–1991)
The fall of the Iron Curtain brought the end of the Cold War east–west division in [Europe](1994), but this geopolitical concept is sometimes still used for quick reference by the media. Another definition was used during the 40 years of Cold War between 1947 and 1989, and was more or less synonymous with the terms Eastern Bloc and Warsaw Pact. A similar definition names the formerly communist [Europe](1994)an states outside the Soviet Union as Eastern [Europe](1994).
Historians and social scientists generally view such definitions as outdated or relegated. Many former Communist states in this region, although their formal alliances were severed by the fall of the [Berlin](1387) Wall, continued to feel a moral duty to support states that have not been "liberated from the tyranny of capitalism". This shared duty collapsed when most of the former Soviet satellites abandoned socialism and adopted capitalism.

EuroVoc
EuroVoc, a multilingual thesaurus maintained by the Publications Office of the [Europe](1994)an Union, classifies Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, plus the candidate countries [Albania](1534), North Macedonia and Serbia as Central and Eastern [Europe](1994)an.

Contemporary developments
[Baltic states](1669)
UNESCO, EuroVoc, National Geographic Society, Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography, and the STW Thesaurus for Economics place the [Baltic states](1669) in Northern [Europe](1994), whereas the CIA World Factbook places the region in Eastern [Europe](1994) with a strong assimilation to Northern [Europe](1994). They are members of the Nordic-Baltic Eight regional cooperation forum whereas Central [Europe](1994)an countries formed their own alliance called the Visegrád Group. The Northern Future Forum, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Nordic Battlegroup, the Nordic-Baltic Eight and the New Hanseatic League are other examples of Northern [Europe](1994)an cooperation that includes the three countries collectively referred to as the [Baltic states](1669).

Estonia
Latvia
Lithuania

Caucasus states
The South Caucasus nations of [Armenia](1567), [Azerbaijan](1588), and Georgia are included in definitions or histories of Eastern [Europe](1994). They are located in the transition zone of Eastern [Europe](1994) and Western [Asia](1914). They participate in the [Europe](1994)an Union's Eastern Partnership program, the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, and are members of the Council of [Europe](1994), which specifies that all three have political and cultural connections to [Europe](1994). In January 2002, the [Europe](1994)an Parliament noted that [Armenia](1567) and Georgia may enter the EU in the future. Georgia and [Armenia](1567) are seeking EU membership, with Georgia also seeking NATO membership alongside.

[Armenia](1567)
[Azerbaijan](1588)
Georgia
There are two de facto republics with limited recognition in the South Caucasus region that exist under the presence of Russian military. Both states participate in the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations: 

[Abkhazia](1520)
South Ossetia
Former republics with limited recognition:

Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (1991–2000) – existed in former Soviet territory until it was driven into exile during the Second Chechen War
Republic of Artsakh (1991–2023) – breakaway state from [Azerbaijan](1588) that ceased to exist by 1 January 2024

Post-Soviet states
Some [Europe](1994)an republics of the former Soviet Union are considered a part of Eastern [Europe](1994):

[Belarus](1683)
Moldova (sometimes considered a part of the Balkans or Southeast [Europe](1994))
Russia
Ukraine
Unrecognized states:

Transnistria

Central [Europe](1994)
The term "Central [Europe](1994)" is often used by historians to designate states formerly belonging to the Holy Roman Empire, the Habsburg Empire, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In some media, "Central [Europe](1994)" can thus partially overlap with "Eastern [Europe](1994)" of the Cold War Era. The following countries are labelled Central [Europe](1994)an by some commentators, though others still consider them to be Eastern [Europe](1994)an.

[Czech Republic](1975)
Croatia (can variously be included in Southeastern or Central [Europe](1994))
Hungary (most often placed in Central [Europe](1994) but sometimes in Southeastern [Europe](1994))
Lithuania (can variously be included in Northeastern or Central [Europe](1994))
Poland
Romania (can be included in Southeastern [Europe](1994) or partially in Central [Europe](1994))
Serbia (most often placed in Southeastern [Europe](1994) but sometimes partially included in Central [Europe](1994))
Slovakia
Slovenia (most often placed in Central [Europe](1994) but sometimes in Southeastern [Europe](1994))

Southeastern [Europe](1994)
Some countries in Southeast [Europe](1994) can be considered part of Eastern [Europe](1994). Some of them can sometimes, albeit rarely, be characterized as belonging to Southern [Europe](1994), and some may also be included in Central [Europe](1994).
In some media, "Southeast [Europe](1994)" can thus partially overlap with "Eastern [Europe](1994)" of the Cold War Era. The following countries are labelled Southeast [Europe](1994)an by some commentators, though others still consider them to be Eastern [Europe](1994)an.

[Albania](1534)
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Cyprus (Geographically located in [Asia](1914), though most often considered a part of Southeastern [Europe](1994))
Croatia (can variously be included in Southeastern or Central [Europe](1994))
Greece (Sometimes grouped in Southern [Europe](1994) with countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal)
Hungary (most often placed in Central [Europe](1994) but sometimes in Southeastern [Europe](1994))
Moldova (usually grouped with the non-Baltic post-Soviet states but sometimes considered part of Southeastern [Europe](1994))
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Romania (can variously be included in Southeastern or Central [Europe](1994))
Serbia (mostly placed in Southeastern but sometimes in Central [Europe](1994))
Slovenia (most often placed in Central [Europe](1994) but sometimes in Southeastern [Europe](1994))
Turkey (East Thrace, the portion west of the Turkish Straits)
Partially recognized states:

Kosovo

Kazakhstan
Despite being frequently classified as a Central [Asia](1914)n country, about 4% of Kazakhstan's territory, situated west of the Ural River, geographically lies in Eastern [Europe](1994), thus technically making it a transcontinental country.

History
Classical antiquity and medieval origins
Ancient kingdoms of the region included Orontid [Armenia](1567), Caucasian [Albania](1534), Colchis and Iberia (not to be confused with the Iberian Peninsula in Western [Europe](1994)), of which the former two were the predecessor states of [Armenia](1567) and [Azerbaijan](1588) respectively, while the latter two were the predecessor states of modern-day Georgia. These peripheral kingdoms were, either from the start or later on, incorporated into various Iranian empires, including the Achaemenid Persian, Parthian, and Sassanid Persian Empires. Parts of the Balkans and some more northern areas were ruled by the Achaemenid Persians as well, including Thrace, Paeonia, Macedon, and most of the [Black Sea](1694) coastal regions of Romania, Ukraine, and Russia. Owing to the rivalry between the Parthian Empire and Rome, and later between Byzantium and the Sassanid Persians, the Parthians would invade the region several times, although it was never able to hold the area, unlike the Sassanids who controlled most of the Caucasus during their entire rule.

The earliest known distinctions between east and west in [Europe](1994) originate in the history of the Roman Republic. As the Roman domain expanded, a cultural and linguistic division appeared. The mainly Greek-speaking eastern provinces had formed the highly urbanized Hellenistic civilization. In contrast, the western territories largely adopted the Latin language. This cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east–west division of the Roman Empire. The division between these two spheres deepened during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages due to a number of events. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, marking the start of the Early Middle Ages. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire—the Byzantine Empire—had a survival strategy that kept it alive for another 1,000 years.
The rise of the Frankish Empire in the west, and in particular the Great Schism that formally divided Eastern and Western Christianity in 1054, heightened the cultural and religious distinctiveness between Eastern and Western [Europe](1994). Much of Eastern [Europe](1994) was invaded and occupied by the Mongols.
During the Ostsiedlung, towns founded under Magdeburg rights became centers of economic development and scattered German settlements were founded in parts of Eastern [Europe](1994). Introduction of German town law is often seen as a second great step after introduction of Christianity at the turn of the first and second millennia. The ensuing modernization of society and economy allowed the increased role played by the rulers of Bohemia and Poland.

1453 to 1918
The conquest of the Byzantine Empire, center of the Eastern Orthodox Church, by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, and the gradual fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire (which had replaced the Frankish empire) led to a change of the importance of Catholic/Protestant vs. Eastern Orthodox concept in [Europe](1994). Armour points out that Cyrillic-alphabet use is not a strict determinant for Eastern [Europe](1994), where from Croatia to Poland and everywhere in between, the Latin alphabet is used. Greece's status as the cradle of Western civilization and an integral part of the Western world in the political, cultural and economic spheres has led to it being nearly always classified as belonging not to Eastern, but Southern or Western [Europe](1994). During the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries, Eastern [Europe](1994) enjoyed a relatively high standard of living. This period is also called the east-central [Europe](1994)an golden age of around 1600. At the beginning of the 17th century, numeracy levels in eastern [Europe](1994) were relatively low, although regional differences existed. During the 18th century, the regions began to catch up with western [Europe](1994), but did not develop as rapidly. Areas with stronger female autonomy developed more quickly in terms of numeracy.

Serfdom
Serfdom was a prevalent status of agricultural workers until the 19th century. It resembled slavery in terms of lack of freedom, with the distinction that the landowners could not buy and sell serfs separately from the specific plots of land that they were permanently attached to. The system emerged in the 14th and 15th century, the same time it was declining in Western [Europe](1994). The climax came in the 17th and 18th century. The early 19th century saw its decline, marked especially by the abolition of serfdom in Russia in 1861. Emancipation meant that the ex-serfs paid for their freedom with annual cash payments to their former masters for decades. The system varied widely country by country, and was not as standardized as in Western [Europe](1994). Historians, until the 20th century, focused on master-serf economic and labor relations, portraying the serfs as slave-like, passive, and isolated. 20th century scholars downplayed the evils and emphasize the complexities.

Lack of industrialization during the long 19th century
Before 1870, the industrialization that had started to develop in Northwestern and Central [Europe](1994) and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in Eastern [Europe](1994), industrialization lagged far behind. Russia, for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.

Interwar period (1919–1939)
A major result of the First World War was the breakup of the Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires, as well as partial losses to the German Empire. A surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in Eastern [Europe](1994), validated by the Versailles Treaty of 1919. Poland was reconstituted after the partitions of the 1790s had divided it between Germany, [Austria](1585), and Russia. New countries included Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine (which was soon absorbed by the Soviet Union), Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. [Austria](1585) and Hungary had much-reduced boundaries. The new states included sizeable ethnic minorities, which were to be protected according to the League of Nations minority protection regime. Throughout Eastern [Europe](1994), ethnic Germans constituted by far the largest single ethnic minority. In some areas, as in the Sudetenland, regions of Poland, and in parts of Slovenia, German speakers constituted the local majority, creating upheaval regarding demands of self-determination.
Romania, Bulgaria, and [Albania](1534) likewise were independent. Many of the countries were still largely rural, with little industry and only a few urban centres. Nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements. Nearly all became democratic in the 1920s, but all of them (except Czechoslovakia and Finland) gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s, in favor of autocratic, strong-man or single-party states. The new states were unable to form stable military alliances, and one by one were too weak to stand up against Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, which took them over between 1938 and 1945.

World War II and onset of the Cold War
Russia ended its participation in the First World War in March 1918 and lost territory, as the Baltic countries and Poland became independent. The region was the main battlefield in the Second World War (1939–45), with German and Soviet armies sweeping back and forth, with millions of Jews and others killed by the Nazis in the Generalplan Ost, and millions of others killed by disease, starvation, and military action, or executed after being deemed as politically dangerous. During the final stages of World War II the future of Eastern [Europe](1994) was decided by the overwhelming power of the Soviet Red Army, as it swept the Germans aside. It did not reach Yugoslavia and [Albania](1534), however. Finland was free but forced to be neutral in the upcoming Cold War.
Throughout Eastern [Europe](1994), German-speaking populations were expelled to the reduced borders of Germany in one of the largest ethnic cleansing operations in history. Regions where Germans had formed the local population majority were re-settled with Polish- or Czech-speakers.
The region fell to Soviet control and Communist governments were imposed. Yugoslavia, [Albania](1534) (and later Romania) had their own Communist regimes independent of Moscow. The Eastern Bloc at the onset of the Cold War in 1947 was far behind the Western [Europe](1994)an countries in economic rebuilding and economic progress. Winston Churchill, in his well-known "Sinews of Peace" address of 5 March 1946, at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, stressed the geopolitical impact of the "iron curtain":

From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern [Europe](1994): Warsaw, [Berlin](1387), Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest, and Sofia.

Eastern Bloc
Eastern [Europe](1994) after 1945 usually meant all the [Europe](1994)an countries liberated from Nazi Germany and then occupied by the Soviet army. It included the German Democratic Republic (also known as East Germany), formed by the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. All the countries in Eastern [Europe](1994) adopted communist modes of control by 1948. These countries were officially independent of the Soviet Union, but the practical extent of this independence was quite limited. Yugoslavia and [Albania](1534) had Communist control that was independent of the Kremlin.
The communists had a natural reservoir of popularity in that they had destroyed the Nazi invaders. Their goal was to guarantee long-term working-class solidarity. The Soviet secret police, the NKVD, working in collaboration with local communists, created secret police forces using leadership trained in Moscow. This new secret police arrived to arrest political enemies according to prepared lists. The national Communists then took power in a gradualist manner, backed by the Soviets in many, but not all, cases. For a while, cooperative non-Communist parties were tolerated. The Communist governments nationalized private businesses, placing them under state ownership, and monitored the media and churches. When dividing up government offices with coalition partners, the Communists took control of the interior ministries, which controlled the local police. They also took control of the mass media, especially radio, as well as the education system. They confiscated and redistributed farmland, and seized control of or replaced the organizations of civil society, such as church groups, sports, youth groups, trade unions, farmers' organizations, and civic organizations. In some countries, they engaged in large-scale ethnic cleansing, moving ethnic groups such as Germans, Poles, Ukrainians and Hungarians far away from where they previously lived, often with high loss of life, to relocate them within the new post-war borders of their respective countries.
Under Stalin's direct instructions, these nations rejected grants from the American Marshall Plan. Instead, they joined the Molotov Plan, which later evolved into the Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). When NATO was created in 1949, most countries of Eastern [Europe](1994) became members of the opposing Warsaw Pact, forming a geopolitical concept that became known as the Eastern Bloc. This consisted of:

First and foremost was the Soviet Union (which included the modern-day territories of Russia, [Belarus](1683), Ukraine and Moldova and the illegally occupied Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia). Other countries dominated by the Soviet Union were the German Democratic Republic, People's Republic of Poland, Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, People's Republic of Hungary, People's Republic of Bulgaria, and Socialist Republic of Romania.
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY; formed after World War II and before its later dismemberment) was not a member of the Warsaw Pact. It was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, an organization created in an attempt to avoid being assigned to either the NATO or Warsaw Pact blocs. The movement was demonstratively independent of both the Soviet Union and the Western bloc for most of the Cold War period, allowing Yugoslavia and its other members to act as a business and political mediator between the blocs.
The Socialist People's Republic of [Albania](1534) broke with the Soviet Union in the early 1960s as a result of the Sino-Soviet split, aligning itself instead with China. [Albania](1534) formally left the Warsaw pact in September 1968 after the suppression of the Prague Spring. When China established diplomatic relations with the United States in 1978, [Albania](1534) also broke away from China. [Albania](1534) and especially Yugoslavia were not unanimously appended to the Eastern Bloc, as they were neutral for a large part of the Cold War period.

Since 1989
With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the political landscape of the Eastern Bloc, and indeed the world, changed. In the German reunification, the Federal Republic of Germany peacefully absorbed the German Democratic Republic in 1990. In 1991, COMECON, the Warsaw Pact, and the Soviet Union were dissolved. Many [Europe](1994)an nations that had been part of the Soviet Union declared or regained their independence ([Belarus](1683), Moldova, Ukraine, as well as the Baltic States of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia). Czechoslovakia peacefully separated into the [Czech Republic](1975) and Slovakia in 1993. Many countries of this region joined the [Europe](1994)an Union, namely Bulgaria, the [Czech Republic](1975), Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. The term "EU11 countries" refer to the Central and Eastern [Europe](1994)an member states, including the [Baltic states](1669), that accessed in 2004 and after: in 2004 the [Czech Republic](1975), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic; in 2007 Bulgaria, Romania; and in 2013 Croatia.
The economic changes were in harmony with the constitutional reforms: constitutional provisions on public finances can be identified and, in some countries, a separate chapter deals with public finances. Generally, they soon encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth, and high government debt. By 2000 these economies were stabilized, and between 2004 and 2013 all of them joined the [Europe](1994)an Union. Most of the constitutions define directly or indirectly the economic system of the countries parallel to the democratic transition of the 1990s: free-market economy (sometimes complemented with the socially and ecologically oriented sector), economic development, or only economic rights are included as a ground for the economy.
In the case of fiscal policy, the legislative, the executive and other state organs (Budget Council, Economic and Social Council) define and manage the budgeting. The average government debt in the countries is nearly 44%, but the deviation is great because the lowest figure is close to 10% but the highest is 97%. The trend shows that the sovereign debt ratio to GDP in most countries has been rising. Only three countries are affected by high government debt: Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia (over 70% of the GDP), while Slovakia and Poland fulfill the Maastricht requirement but only 10% below the threshold. The contribution to cover the finances for common needs is declared, the principle of just tax burden-sharing is supplemented sometimes with special aspects. Tax revenues expose typically 15–19 % of the GDP, and rates above 20% only rarely can be found.
The state audit of the government budget and expenditures is an essential control element in public finances and an important part of the concept of checks and balances. The central banks are independent state institutions, which possess a monopoly on managing and implementing a state's or federation's monetary policy. Besides monetary policy, some of them even perform the supervision of the financial intermediary system. In the case of a price stability function, the inflation rate, in the examined area, relatively quickly dropped to below 5% by 2000. In monetary policy the differences are based on the euro-zone: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia use the common currency. The economies of this decade – similar to the previous one – show a moderate inflation. As a new phenomenon, a slight negative inflation (deflation) appeared in this decade in several countries (Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia), which demonstrates sensitivity regarding international developments. The majority of the constitutions determine the national currency, legal tender or monetary unit. The local currency exchange rate to the U.S. dollar shows that drastic interventions were not necessary. National wealth or assets are the property of the state or local governments and, as an exclusive property, the management and protection of them aim at serving the public interest.
