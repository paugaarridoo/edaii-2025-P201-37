Bergensk
[Bergen](1431)sk or [Bergen](1431) dialect is a dialect of Norwegian used in [Bergen](1431), Norway. It is easy for Norwegians to recognise, as it is more distinguishable from other dialects in Vestland than, for example, the Stavanger dialect (Stavangersk) from the dialects of Rogaland, and the Trondheim dialect from Trøndelag dialects.

Early influence from Low German and Danish
Many Low German and German words found their way to Norwegian through the [Bergen](1431) dialect, which makes up almost 35% of the basic Norwegian vocabulary. The long history of multi-lingual coexistence in [Bergen](1431) has made the dialect more susceptible to simplifications, in order to ease communication, and the influence of Danish and Low German are apparent in the modern [Bergen](1431) dialect's phonetics.
[Bergen](1431)'s strong foreign influence, such as Hanseatic League merchants in the period from about 1350 to 1750, had a profound effect on the [Bergen](1431) dialect. The Hanseatic merchants spoke varieties of Low German, and perhaps a pidgin in dealings with the locals. [Bergen](1431) was the only major Norwegian city during the Dano-Norwegian union from 1536 to 1814, and the  [Bergen](1431) dialect absorbed more of language trends from abroad, such as from Danish, than other Norwegian dialects. The written standard of the time, was based on the Copenhagen dialect of the Danish language, and it continued to affect [Bergen](1431)sk well into the 20th century. A Dano-Norwegian koiné, resembling the non-standard Riksmål, is still spoken, although in recent decades has become much more similar to [Bokmål](4488).

Gender
[Bergen](1431)sk is one of two dialects in Norway with only two grammatical genders, the other being the dialect spoken in Lyngen Municipality. All others have three (excepting sociolects in other Norwegian urban areas). The feminine gender disappeared in the 16th century. One theory is that this was partly fueled by an influence from Danish, which became the written language and already had abolished the distinction between masculine and feminine forms, and as a simplification to ease communication between Norwegians and Germans or between people from [Bergen](1431) and other parts of Norway.
The Old Norse -n ending was retained in the [Bergen](1431) (Old Norse hon > hon), but lost elsewhere (hon > ho). The -nn ending was simplified to -n everywhere. Since the feminine definite articles were -in and -an in Old Norse, while the masculine ending was -inn, another theory is that the retention of -n, combined with an earlier reduction of unstressed vowels, caused the masculine and feminine genders to merge. In other dialects, -in and -an lost the final -n, underwent nasalization and developed into -a in a majority of the modern Norwegian dialects (other variants include -e, -i and -o) whereas -inn developed into -en.

Definite form of given names
[Bergen](1431)sk is one of the few Norwegian dialects that can use the definite for given names. In [Bergen](1431) personal names can be inflected like common nouns, so Kari becomes Karien, Pere becomes Peren or Kåre Willoch becomes Kåre Willochen. Not all [Bergen](1431)sk speakers will use this form and the usage depends on the social situation. Similar construction of personal names can be found in east Norwegian dialects.

Phonology
The /r/ phoneme is realized uvularly, either as a trill ʀ or a fricative ʁ. The latter is the normal French pronunciation. It probably spread to [Bergen](1431) (and Kristiansand) some time in the 18th century, overtaking the alveolar trill r in the time span of about 2-3 generations. Until recent decades' developments in neighboring rural dialects, this was an easy way of distinguishing them from the [Bergen](1431) dialect. Nowadays, the uvular /r/ is a feature of a much larger area of the southwestern Norway than [Bergen](1431). Broader speakers may realize the coda /r/ as a central vowel ɐ, but that is stigmatized.

/n, t, d, l/ are alveolar n, t, d, l.
As in Stavanger and Oslo, younger speakers of the [Bergen](1431) dialect tend to merge /ç/ with /ʃ/.

Recent developments
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the literacy rate improved, which gave a strong influence from Riksmål, and later [Bokmål](4488). Nynorsk, Norway's other written language, was considered rural and thus lacking prestige, and has not had a strong influence on the dialect. Subsequently, large parts of the German-inspired vocabulary unique for [Bergen](1431) disappeared. Plural endings are used less frequently, for example huser (houses) has become hus, which is correct [Bokmål](4488). Also, pronunciations have shifted slightly towards standard East Norwegian (Standard Østnorsk), probably as a result of the shift of power towards Oslo. For example, "pære" (pear), which was formerly pronounced as péræ, is now pronounced pæræ.

Modern [Bergen](1431)sk compared to [Bokmål](4488) and Nynorsk
Like almost all Norwegian dialects, [Bergen](1431)sk cannot be said to be either [Bokmål](4488) or Nynorsk. While the vocabulary shows traits of both [Bokmål](4488) and Nynorsk, it has characteristics that are not covered by any of these written standards. Also, [Bokmål](4488) is often associated with Eastern Norwegian Standard Østnorsk pronunciation—although no official affiliation exists. This gives the claim that oral [Bergen](1431)sk "is" partly [Bokmål](4488) ambiguities. Although Nynorsk (Neo-Norwegian) has its stronghold in western Norway and the areas surrounding [Bergen](1431), the inhabitants of [Bergen](1431) itself write [Bokmål](4488).

English verbs
When English verbs are used as substitute for Norwegian verbs, in the past tense they are given an -et ending, like walket and drivet. This is different from the other Norwegian dialects, most of which use an -a ending.
