Life and career
Reimann was born in Berlin on 4 March 1936. His father, Wolfgang Reimann, served as choirmaster at Berlin Cathedral; his mother was an oratorio singer and voice teacher. As a boy of age 10, he performed in a production of the school opera (Schuloper) Der Jasager. He studied at the Musikhochschule Berlin, composition and counterpoint with Boris Blacher and Ernst Pepping, and piano with Otto Rausch. During his studies, he worked as a répétiteur at the Städtische Oper. His first appearances as a pianist and accompanist were in 1957. He moved to Vienna to study musicology in 1958.
Working with singers such as Catherine Gayer, Brigitte Fassbaender and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau increased his sensibility for the potential of voices. His first work for the stage was a ballet, Stoffreste, to a libretto by Günter Grass and first performed in 1959. His first opera was in 1965 Ein Traumspiel, to a libretto that Carla Henius based on Strindberg's A Dream Play in the translation by Peter Weiss; it was premiered on 20 June 1965 at the Opernhaus Kiel. His fourth opera, Lear based on Shakespeare's play, was inspired by Fischer-Dieskau who portrayed Lear in the first performance at the Bavarian State Opera in 1978. The opera became a lasting success with 30 productions as of 2024. His commissioned work, Cantus for Clarinet and Orchestra, dedicated to the clarinetist and composer Jörg Widmann, was premiered on 13 January 2006, in the WDR's Large Broadcasting Hall in Cologne, Germany, in the presence of the composer, who claimed the work was inspired by Claude Debussy's compositions for clarinet. His opera Medea, after Franz Grillparzer, was premiered at the Vienna State Opera in 2010, conducted by Michael Boder, with Marlis Petersen in the title role. It was chosen as world premiere of the year by critics.
In the early 1970s, Reimann became a member of the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. He was professor of contemporary Lied at the Musikhochschule Hamburg from 1974 to 1983, then at Berlin's Hochschule der Künste from 1983 to 1998. Reimann was co-editor and pianist of the record label Orfeo's album series Edition zeitgenössisches Lied (contemporary song).
He was honoured repeatedly, including the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Order of Merit of Berlin. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the seventh composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1997, in songs and chamber music with the Auryn Quartet, playing the piano himself. In 2011 Reimann was awarded the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize "for his life's work".
Reimann was gay and lived in Berlin. Reimann died on 13 March 2024, at the age of 88.
