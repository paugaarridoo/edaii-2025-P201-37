African historiography
[Africa](1700)n historiography is a branch of historiography concerning the [Africa](1700)n continent, its peoples, nations and variety of written and non-written histories. It has differentiated itself from other continental areas of historiography due to its multidisciplinary nature, as [Africa](1700)'s unique and varied methods of recording history have resulted in a lack of an established set of historical works documenting events before European colonialism. As such, [Africa](1700)n historiography has lent itself to contemporary methods of historiographical study and the incorporation of anthropological and sociological analysis.
The chronology of [Africa](1700)n recorded history encompasses many movements of art, [Africa](1700)n nations and dialects, and its history has permeated through many mediums. History concerning much of the pre-colonialist [Africa](1700)n continent is depicted through art or passed down through oral tradition. As European colonization emerged, the cultural identity and socio-political structure of the continent drastically shifted, and the written documentation of [Africa](1700) and its people was dominated by European academia, which was later acknowledged and criticized in post-colonialist movements of the 20th century.
[Africa](1700)n historiography became organised in the mid 20th century, and saw a movement towards utilising oral sources in a multidisciplinary approach alongside archaeology and historical linguistics, culminating in UNESCO publishing the General History of [Africa](1700) from 1981, edited by specialists from across the continent. Contemporary historians are still tasked with building the institutional frameworks, incorporating [Africa](1700)n epistemologies, establishing a continental periodisation, and representing an [Africa](1700)n perspective.

Antiquity
Much of the modern depiction of [Africa](1700) preceding written history is through archaeology, historical linguistics, and oral tradition. Excluding Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the Ge’ez script, a large part of the [Africa](1700)n continent would not have a means of writing or recording history until the common era.

Oral tradition
Most [Africa](1700)n societies used oral tradition to record their history. They generally have a reverence for the oral word, and have been termed oral civilisations, contrasted with literate civilisations which pride the written word. Jan Vansina pioneered the study of oral tradition in his book Oral tradition as history (1985).

Early written history
Some [Africa](1700)n writing systems have been developed in ancient and recent history, and the continent holds a quantity of varied orthographies. One of the most notable ancient languages were the Egyptian hieroglyphs, which were often found carved into walls, as decoration on objects of religious significance and written on wood and papyrus. Hieroglyphs, like many other ancient [Africa](1700)n dialects, underwent a considerable period of time where there was no verifiable translation. The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, would allow historians to effectively decipher hieroglyphs and access a new field of Ancient Egyptian history. This field was undertaken predominantly by European historians. There are also plenty of written records in Arabic and Ge'ez, as well as European written records during their exploration of [Africa](1700) from the 15th century.

Colonial historiography
Prior to colonisation in the 19th century, most [Africa](1700)n societies used oral tradition to record their history, meaning there was little written history. The domination of European powers across the continent meant [Africa](1700)n history was written from an entirely European perspective under the pretence of Western superiority. This predilection stemmed from the perceived technological superiority of European nations and the decentralization of the [Africa](1700)n continent with no nation being a clear power in the region, as well as a perception of [Africa](1700)ns as racially inferior, supporting their "civilising mission". Another factor was there being a multitude of different dialects, cultural groups and fluctuating nations as well as a diverse set of mediums that document history other than written word. Oral sources deprecated and dismissed by unfamiliar historians, giving them the impression [Africa](1700) had no recorded history and had little desire to create it.
The historical works of the time were predominantly written by scholars of the various European powers and were confined to individual nations, leading to disparities in style, quality, language and content between the many [Africa](1700)n nations. These works mostly concerned the activities of the European powers and centered on events concerning economic and military endeavors of the powers in the region. Examples of British works were Lilian Knowles' The Economic Development of the British Overseas Empire and Allan McPhees The Economic Revolution in British West [Africa](1700), which discuss the economic achievements of the British empire and the state of affairs in [Africa](1700)n nations controlled by Britain.

Post-colonialist historiography
Post-colonialist historiography studies the relationship between European colonialism and domination in [Africa](1700) and the construction of [Africa](1700)n history and representation. It has roots in Orientalism, the construction of cultures from the Asian, Arabian and North [Africa](1700)n world in a patronizing manner stemming from a sense of Western superiority, first theorized by Edward Said. A general perception of Western superiority throughout European academics and historians prominent during the height of colonialism led to the defining traits of colonial historical works, which post-colonialists have sought to analyse and criticize.
The struggles for independence in the 1950s and 1960s saw a movement towards decolonising [Africa](1700)n history. Post-colonial works are characterised by their nationalist sentiments and [Afrocentrism](1793), reflecting [Africa](1700)n politics at the time. The period saw a methodological revolution regarding the use of oral sources, archaeology, and historical linguistics. Periodisation has often focussed on [Africa](1700)'s interactions with outsiders. Despite this, there were major challenges which persist, such as "academic labour migration" and reliance on Western publishers inhibiting the growth of institutions in [Africa](1700).

William Macmillan and the effect of colonialism
William Miller Macmillan is a historian and post-colonialist thinker. His historical work, [Africa](1700) Emergent (1938), critiqued colonial rule and sought for the democratization of [Africa](1700)n nations in seeking [Africa](1700)n representation in governments. The work not only condemns colonial rule, but also considers the perspectives of and the effect of colonialism on the [Africa](1700)n people, a considerable difference from the works’ contemporaries. He was a founder of the liberal school of South [Africa](1700)n historiography and as a forerunner of the radical school of historiography that emerged in the 1970s. He was also a critic of colonial rule and an early advocate of self-government for colonial territories in [Africa](1700) and of what became known as development aid.

Kenneth Dike, oral sources, and the General History of [Africa](1700)
In the mid-20th century Kenneth Dike, among other members of the Ibadan School, pioneered a new methodology of reconstructing [Africa](1700)n history using the oral traditions, and alongside evidence from European-style histories and other historical sciences, destabilising the notion that [Africa](1700)'s history was essentially its interactions with Europeans.: 212  This movement towards utilising oral sources in a multi-disciplinary approach culminated in UNESCO commissioning the General History of [Africa](1700), edited by specialists drawn from across the [Africa](1700)n continent, publishing from 1981 to 2024.

Contemporary historiography
Acknowledgement and acceptance of [Africa](1700)n nations and peoples as individuals free of European domination has allowed [Africa](1700)n history to be approached from new perspectives and with new methods. [Africa](1700) has lacked a defined means of communication or academic body due to its variety of cultures and communities, and the plurality and diversity of its many peoples means a historiographical approach that confines itself to the development and activity of a singular people or nation incapable of capturing the comprehensive history of [Africa](1700)n nations without a vast quantity of historical works. 
There is no agreed upon periodisation for [Africa](1700) history, with the difference in temporal stages of state formation between parts of the continent providing disagreement. Oliver and Atmore proposed Medieval [Africa](1700) as from 1250 to 1800. Contemporary historians are still tasked with building the institutional frameworks, incorporating [Africa](1700)n epistemologies, and representing an [Africa](1700)n perspective.

Institutions
[Africa](1700)n historiography became organized at the academic level in the mid-20th century. The School of Oriental Studies opened at the University of London in 1916. It became the School of Oriental and [Africa](1700)n Studies in 1938 and has always been at the center of scholarship on [Africa](1700). In the U.S. Northwestern University launched its Program of [Africa](1700)n Studies in 1948. The first scholarly journals were founded: Transactions of the Gold Coast & Togoland Historical Society (1952); Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria (1956); The Journal of [Africa](1700)n History (1960); Cahiers d’études africaines (1960); and [Africa](1700)n Historical Studies (1968). Specialists grouped together in the [Africa](1700)n Studies Association (1957); the [Africa](1700)n Studies Association of the UK (1963); the Canadian Association of [Africa](1700)n Studies/Association Canadienne des Etudes [Africa](1700)ines (1970).
