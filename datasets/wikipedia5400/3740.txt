Alcetas I of Epirus
Alcetas I (Greek: Ἀλκέτας) (390/385 – 370 BC) was a king of Epirus. He was the son of Tharrhypas.

Biography
Alcetas was expelled from his kingdom for unknown reasons, and took refuge with  Dionysius I of Syracuse, who assisted him in being reinstated.
After Alcetas' restoration, he allied himself with the Athenians and with Jason of Pherae, the Tagus of Thessaly. In 373 BC he appeared in [Athens](599) with Jason, for the purpose of defending the Athenian general Timotheus, who, through their influence, was acquitted. 
Upon Alcetas' death, the kingdom was divided between his two sons, Neoptolemus I and Arybbas.
