Canned tomato
Canned tomatoes, or tinned tomatoes, are tomatoes, usually peeled, that are sealed into a can after having been processed by heat.

Economic aspects
Industrially produced canned tomatoes are internationally a staple product and subject to regular market analysis as well as trade considerations.

Home preservation
Home canned tomatoes may be prepared in a number of ways. However, safety measures need to be taken, since improperly canned tomatoes can cause botulism poisoning, whether produced industrially or at home.
