867
C POSIX library
The C POSIX library is a specification of a [C standard library](877) for POSIX systems. It was developed at the same time as the [ANSI C](803) standard. Some effort was made to make POSIX compatible with standard C; POSIX includes additional functions to those introduced in standard C. On the other hand, the 5 headers that were added to the [C standard library](877) with C11, were not likewise included in subsequent revisions of POSIX.
