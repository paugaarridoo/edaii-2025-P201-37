Alzenau dialect
Halcnovian (Altsnerisch/Päurisch), alternatively spelled Haltsnovian, is an East Central German dialect spoken in the former village of Hałcnów, which is now a district of Bielsko-Biała, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland. It was the vernacular language of Hałcnów until 1945, when ethnic Germans were expelled from Poland. Some examples of the language were recorded in the works of Karl Olma, who was active as a journalist in the Halcnovian exile community in West Germany after World War II. Recently the dialect has been researched from a linguistic standpoint by Marek Dolatowski. In 2016 researchers traced a handful of native speakers of Halcnovian still resident in Hałcnów, and recorded them in order to help preserve the language. The dialect is related to the Wymysorys language.
