American Society of Mammalogists
The American Society of Mammalogists (ASM) was founded in 1919. Its primary purpose is to encourage the study of mammals, and professions studying them. There are over 4,500 members of this society, and they are primarily professional scientists who emphasize the importance of public policy and education.  There are several ASM meetings held each year, and the society manages several publications such as the Journal of Mammalogy, Special Publications, Mammalian Species, and Society Pamphlets.  The best known of these is the Journal of Mammalogy. The ASM also maintains The Mammal Image Library which contains more than 1,300 mammal slides.  A president, vice president, recording secretary, secretary-treasurer, and journal editor are all elected by the members to be officers of the society. In addition, ASM is composed of thirty one committees, including the Animal Care and Use Committee, the Conservation Awards Committee, the International Relations Committee, and the Publications Committee. It also provides numerous grants and awards for research and studies on mammals. These awards can go to both scientists and students. The ASM also lists employment opportunities for their members.

Since 2018, the American Society of Mammalogists has maintained the Mammal Diversity Database, an online checklist of mammal species. The database is maintained by the ASM Biodiversity Committee and "aims to provide a continuously updated listing of the world's mammal species and higher taxa. The latest update (version 1.13) was released on July 13th of 2024, and lists 6,753 species placed in 1,353 genera, 167 families and 27 orders.
