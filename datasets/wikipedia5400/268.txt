Basset Artésien Normand
The [Basset](267) Artésien Normand (Norman Artesian [Basset](267)) is a short legged hound type dog developed in France. The word basset refers to short-legged hounds.

History
The [Basset](267) Artésien Normand and the more familiar [Basset](267) Hound share a common ancestry in the short-legged hounds of northern France of the early 19th century that displayed osteochondrodysplasia dwarfism. But unlike the [Basset](267) Hound, which was developed by English breeders in the late 19th century as a more substantial dog that was initially cross-bred with [Bloodhound](294)s, the [Basset](267)-type dogs that French breeders developed remained lighter-boned and more focused on hunting ability.
Documenting of these French [Basset](267)s as a purebred breed began in 1870, and from a common ancestral type, two strains were developed. One had straight front legs ([Basset](267) d'Artois) and the other had crooked front legs (Normand). The breed club was formed in 1910 and the breed was given its present name in 1924.
[Basset](267)s are walking hounds, which are followed by the hunter on foot. The short legs mean that they would not get too far away from the hunter. The [Basset](267) Artésien Normand was used to hunt rabbits and other small game alone or in packs, but today they are primarily bred to be pets.

Appearance
The height of the [Basset](267) Artésien Normand is between 30 and 36 cm (12 and 14 in), with a ratio of the height to the body length of about 5 : 8. Weight is roughly 17 kg (37 lb). The coat is short and tricolored (fawn and white with black blanket, a patch across the back) or bicolored (fawn and white). The head and long ears are distinctive, and the temperament should be calm and good-natured.

Recognition
The original breed club is the Club français du [Basset](267) Artésien Normand & du Chien d'Artois, and the breed is recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) as breed number 34 in Group 6, Scenthounds. The [Basset](267) Artésien Normand is one of six types of "basset"-type breeds recognised by the FCI. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club (US) in the Scenthound Group.
