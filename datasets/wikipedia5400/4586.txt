Burgenland Croatian
[Burgenland](4585) Croatian (gradišćanskohrvatski jezik; German: Burgenländisch-Kroatisch, [Burgenland](4585)kroatisch, burgenlandkroatische Sprache, burgenländisch-kroatischen Sprache, Hungarian: gradistyei horvát nyelv) is a regional variety of the Chakavian dialect of Croatian spoken in [Austria](1585), Hungary, the [Czech Republic](1975), and Slovakia. [Burgenland](4585) Croatian is recognized as a minority language in the [Austria](1585)n state of [Burgenland](4585), where it is spoken by 19,412 people according to official reports (2001). Many of the [Burgenland](4585) Croatian speakers in [Austria](1585) also live in Vienna and Graz, due to the process of urbanization, which is mostly driven by the poor economic situation of large parts of [Burgenland](4585).
Smaller Croatian minorities in western Hungary, southwestern Slovakia, and southern [Czech Republic](1975) are often also called [Burgenland](4585) Croats. They use the [Burgenland](4585) Croatian written language and are historically and culturally closely connected to the [Austria](1585)n Croats. The representatives of the [Burgenland](4585) Croats estimate their total number in all three countries and emigration at around 70,000.

History
[Burgenland](4585) Croatian was the language of Croatian refugees who fled Croatia during the Croatian–Ottoman wars and settled in the western part of what was then Hungary, the area where they still live. [Burgenland](4585) Croats included speakers of all three dialects of the Croatian language (Shtokavian, Chakavian and Kajkavian), with the majority being the Chakavians. A part of them originally probably came from Dalmatia, and all of them mostly emigrated from the river Una valley.
[Burgenland](4585) Croats did not take part in the shaping of the present standard Croatian in the 19th century. Instead, they constructed their own written standard based mainly on the local Chakavian speech and adopted the Croatian alphabet, a modified Latin alphabet, as their script.
It is still a matter of debate whether [Burgenland](4585) Croatian should be classified as a Slavic micro-language of its own. [Burgenland](4585) Croatian dialects are mostly viewed as isolated dialects of the Croatian.
[Burgenland](4585) Croatian and the Prekmurje Slovene of Slovene (in Prekmurje and Hungary) have influenced each other. The first Prekmurje Slovene works (for example, the Old Hymnal of Martjanci) was applied to the [Burgenland](4585) Croatian books. A few of those that wrote in Prekmurje Slovene were of [Burgenland](4585) Croatian descent (for example Jakab Szabár) and also [Burgenland](4585) Croatian (József Ficzkó).
After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 the areas in which [Burgenland](4585) Croats lived were divided between [Austria](1585), Czechoslovakia and Hungary. After 1921 most of these areas became part of [Austria](1585), which established a new province of [Burgenland](4585), after which the Croatian minority was named. In 1922 [Austria](1585) founded the Apostolic administration of [Burgenland](4585) and began to abolish bilingual schools through the introduction of the teaching of German in all primary schools. This process halted temporarily after the adoption of The National Education Act, which allowed for Croatian-language elementary schools. After Hitler's annexation of [Austria](1585) in 1938 this law was abolished. In 1955 the [Austria](1585)n State Treaty was signed. This permitted the [Burgenland](4585) Croats to use Croatian in education, judiciary and public administration. With the adoption of the Law on National Minorities in 1976, use of Croatian in public life became further limited. As a result of the 1987 acceptance of a constitutional complaint, parts of the law were changed and Croatian was introduced as an official language in 6 out of 7 districts of [Burgenland](4585).

Written language
[Burgenland](4585) Croatian written language is based mainly on the local Chakavian dialect with some influences from the other Croatian dialects spoken in [Burgenland](4585). It uses the Latin alphabet with the same diacritical modifiers as the Croatian alphabet. In the course of language development it acquired some of its own specialised vocabulary, sometimes different from that used in standard Croatian.
The popular The Little Prince has also been translated into [Burgenland](4585) Croatian (1998), specifically the Standard version by Ivan Rotter.
