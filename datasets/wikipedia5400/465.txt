Armatimonadota
Armatimonadota is a phylum of gram-negative bacteria.

History
Armatimonadota was originally described solely on the basis of environmental 16S rRNA gene clone sequences, and was temporarily titled candidate phylum OP10. However, in 2011 a bacterial strain belonging to the phylum was isolated from an aquatic plant in Japan. The species was named Armatimonas rosea and was the first member of its phylum, genus, and species.

Members
Armatimonas rosea, an aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacterium, strain YO-36T, was isolated from rhizoplane of an aquatic plant (a reed, Phragmites australis) inhabiting a freshwater lake in Japan.
Chthonomonas calidirosea, an aerobic, saccharolytic, obligately thermophilic, motile, non-spore-forming bacterium, strain T49(T), was isolated from geothermally heated soil at Hell's Gate, Tikitere, New Zealand.
