Afri
Āfrī (singular Āfer) was a Latin name for the inhabitants of [Africa](1700), referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin speakers at first used āfer as an adjective, meaning "of [Africa](1700)". As a substantive, it denoted a native of Āfrica; i.e., an [Africa](1700)n.

Etymology
The etymology of the term remains uncertain. It may derive from a Punic term for an indigenous population of the area surrounding Carthage. (See Terence for discussion.) The name is usually connected with Phoenician ʿafar "dust" (also found in other Semitic languages), but a 1981 hypothesis asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) "cave", in reference to cave dwellers. (See Tataouine.) The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from [Algeria](1317) and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya. The classical historian Flavius Josephus asserted that descendants of [Abraham](1735)'s grandson Epher invaded the region and gave it their own name.

[Africa](1700)
This ethnonym provided the source of the term [Africa](1700). The Romans referred to the region as [Africa](1700) terra (land of the Afri), based on the stem Afr- with the adjective suffix -ic, giving Africus, [Africa](1700), Africum in the nominative singular of the three Latin genders. Following the defeat of Carthage in the Third Punic War, Rome set up the province of [Africa](1700) Proconsularis. Afer came to be a cognomen for people from this province.
The Germanic tribe of the Vandals conquered the Roman Diocese of [Africa](1700) in the 5th century; the empire reconquered it as the Praetorian prefecture of [Africa](1700) in AD 534. The Latin name [Africa](1700) came into Arabic after the Islamic conquest as Ifriqiya.
The name survives today as Ifira and Ifri-n-Dellal in Greater Kabylie ([Algeria](1317)). A Berber tribe was called Banu Ifran in the Middle Ages, and Ifurace was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century.
Herodotus wrote that the Garamantes, a North [Africa](1700)n people, used to live in caves. The Greeks called an [Africa](1700)n people who lived in caves Troglodytae.
