Corsican language
[Corsica](4785)n (corsu, pronounced ˈkorsu, or lingua corsa, pronounced ˈliŋɡwa ˈɡorsa) is a Romance language consisting of the continuum of the Tuscan Italo-Dalmatian dialects spoken on the Mediterranean island of [Corsica](4785), a territory of France, and in the northern regions of the island of Sardinia, an autonomous region of Italy.
[Corsica](4785), the island proper, is situated approximately 123.9 km (77.0 miles; 66 nautical miles) off the western coast of Tuscany; and with historical connections, the [Corsica](4785)n language is considered a part of Tuscan varieties, from that part of the Italian peninsula, and thus is related to the Florentine-based standard Italian.
Under the long-standing influence of Tuscany's Pisa, and the historic Republic of Genoa, over [Corsica](4785), the [Corsica](4785)n language once filled the role of a vernacular, with Italian functioning as the island's official language until France acquired the island from the Republic of Genoa (1768); by 1859, French had replaced Italian as [Corsica](4785)'s first language so much so that, by the time of the Liberation of France (1945), nearly every islander had at least a working-knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a vast language shift, with the islanders adapting and changing their communications to the extent that there were no monolingual [Corsica](4785)n-speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65% of islanders had some degree of proficiency in [Corsica](4785)n, and a minority of around 10% used [Corsica](4785)n as a first language.

Classification
[Corsica](4785)n is classed as a regional language under French law. It is almost universally agreed that [Corsica](4785)n is typologically and traditionally Italo-Romance, but its specific position therein is more controversial. Some scholars argue that [Corsica](4785)n belongs to the Centro-Southern Italian dialects, while others are of the opinion that it is closely related to, or as part of, Italy's Tuscan dialect varieties. Italian and the dialects of [Corsica](4785)n (especially Northern [Corsica](4785)n) are in fact very mutually intelligible. Southern [Corsica](4785)n, in spite of the geographical proximity, has as its closest linguistic neighbour not Sardinian (a separate group with which it is not mutually intelligible), but rather the Extreme Southern Italian dialects like Siculo-Calabrian. It has been theorised, on the other hand, that a Sardinian variety, or a variety very similar to Sardo-Romance, might have been originally spoken in [Corsica](4785) prior to the island's Tuscanisation under Pisan and Genoese rule.
The matter is controversial in light of the historical, cultural and particularly strong linguistic bonds that [Corsica](4785) had traditionally formed with the Italian Mainland from the Middle Ages until the 19th century: in contrast to the neighbouring Sardinia, [Corsica](4785)'s installment into a diglossic system with Italian as the island's prestige language ran so deep that both [Corsica](4785)n and Italian might be even, and in fact were, perceived as two sociolinguistic levels of a single language. [Corsica](4785)n and Italian traditionally existed on a spectrum, and the dividing lines between them were blurred enough that the locals needed little else but a change of register to communicate in an official setting. "Tuscanising" their tongue, or as the [Corsica](4785)n elites would have once said, parlà in crusca ("speaking in crusca", from the name of the Academy dedicated to the standardisation of the [Italian language](4701)), allowed for a practice not of code-switching, but rather of code-mixing which is quite typical of the Mainland Italian dialects. Italian was perceived as different from [Corsica](4785)n, but not as much as the differences between the two main isoglosses of Northern and Southern [Corsica](4785)n, as spoken by their respective native speakers. When Pasquale Paoli found himself exiled in London, he replied to Samuel Johnson's query on the peculiar existence of a "rustic language" very different from Italian that such a language existed only in Sardinia; in fact, the existence of [Corsica](4785)n as the island's native vernacular did not take anything away from Paoli's claims that [Corsica](4785)'s official language was Italian.
Today's [Corsica](4785)n is the result of these historical vicissitudes, which have morphed the language to an idiom that bears a strong resemblance to the medieval Tuscan once spoken at the time of [Dante](3390) and Boccaccio, and still existing in peripheral Tuscany (Lucca, Garfagnana, Elba, Capraia). The correspondence of modern [Corsica](4785)n to ancient Tuscan can be seen from almost any aspect of the language, ranging from the phonetics, morphology, lexicon to the syntax. One of the characteristics of standard Italian is the retention of the -re infinitive ending, as in Latin mittere "send"; such infinitival ending is lost in Tuscan as well as [Corsica](4785)n, resulting in the outcome mette / metta, "to put". Whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for "who" is chi and "what" is che/(che) cosa, it is an uninflected chì in [Corsica](4785)n. The only unifying, as well as distinctive, feature which separates the [Corsica](4785)n dialects from the mainland Tuscan ones, with the exception of Amiatino, Pitiglianese, and Capraiese, is the retention of word-final o-u. For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns questo "this" and quello "that" become in [Corsica](4785)n questu or quistu and quellu or quiddu: this feature was also typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.
Even after the acquisition of [Corsica](4785) by Louis XV, Italian continued to be the island's language of education, literature, religion and local affairs. The affluent youth still went to Italy to pursue higher studies. (It has been estimated that [Corsica](4785)n presence in Pisa amounted to a fourth of the University's total student body in 1830.) Local civil registers continued to be written in Italian until 1855; it was on 9 May 1859, that Italian was replaced by French as the island's official language, although the latter would start to take root among the islanders from 1882 onwards, through the Jules Ferry laws aimed at spreading literacy across the French provinces. Even so, a specifically homegrown [Corsica](4785)n (rather than Italian) literature in [Corsica](4785) only developed belatedly and, in its earliest phase, there were no autonomous cultural instances; [Corsica](4785)n writers, such as Salvatore Viale, even prided themselves on their affiliation to the broader Italian sphere, considering [Corsica](4785)n "one of the lowest, impure dialects of Italy".
It was the Italian Fascist aggressive claims to the island in the 20th century, followed by their invasion, that provoked a popular backlash, estranging the native islanders from standard Italian and, if anything, only accelerated their shifting to the French even further. By the Liberation of France, any previously existing link between the two linguistic varieties and with Italy altogether had been severed; any promotion of [Corsica](4785)n, which had been politicized by the local collaborators with the regime, would be met with popular criticism and even suspicion of potentially harboring irredentist sentiments. From then on, [Corsica](4785)n would grow independently of Italian to become, later in the 1970s, a centerpiece of the Riacquistu ("reacquisition") movement for the rediscovery of [Corsica](4785)n culture. Nationalist calls for [Corsica](4785)n to be put on the same footing as French led the French National Assembly, in 1974, to extend the 1951 Deixonne Law, which initially recognized only a few languages (Breton, Basque, Catalan and Occitan), to including [Corsica](4785)n as well, among others, not as a dialect of Italian, but as one of France's full-fledged regional languages.(See governmental support.)

Origins
The common relationship between [Corsica](4785) and central Italy can be traced from as far back as the Etruscans, who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC. In 40 AD, the natives of [Corsica](4785) reportedly did not speak Latin. The Roman exile, Seneca the Younger, reported that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he was not able to understand. More specifically, Seneca claimed that the island's population was the result of the stratification of different ethnic groups, such as the Greeks, the Ligures (see the Ligurian hypothesis) and the Iberians, whose language had long since stopped being recognizable among the population due to the intermixing of the other two groups. The occupation of the island by the Vandals around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers. (See Medieval [Corsica](4785).) If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire.
Modern [Corsica](4785)n has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in [Corsica](4785)n affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers, such as the Papal States (828–1077), the Republic of Pisa (1077–1282) and the Republic of Genoa (1282–1768), and finally by France which, since 1859, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term "gallicised [Corsica](4785)n" refers to the evolution of [Corsica](4785)n starting from about the year 1950, whereas "distanciated [Corsica](4785)n" refers to an idealized variety of [Corsica](4785)n following linguistic purism, by means of removing any French-derived elements.

Dialects
[Corsica](4785)
The two most widely spoken forms of the [Corsica](4785)n language are the groups spoken in the Bastia and Corte area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as Haute-Corse, Cismonte or [Corsica](4785) suprana), and the groups spoken around Sartène and Porto-Vecchio (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as Corse-du-Sud, Pumonti or [Corsica](4785) suttana). The dialect of [Ajaccio](4710) has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio (Bonifacino) are dialects of the Ligurian language.
This division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in [Corsica](4785) during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern [Corsica](4785)n dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern [Corsica](4785)n varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to Sicilian and, only to some extent, Sardinian.

Northern [Corsica](4785)n
The Northern [Corsica](4785)n macro variety (Supranacciu, Supranu, Cismuntincu or Cismontano) is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West [Corsica](4785) around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialects of Bastia and Cap Corse belong to the Western Tuscan dialects; they being, with the exception of Florentine, the closest to standard Italian. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional formed in -ebbe (e.g. (ella) amarebbe "she would love") are generally considered Cismontani dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of Piana, Vico, Vizzavona, Ghisoni and Ghisonaccia, and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses lu, li, la, le as definite articles), Bastia (besides i > e and a > e, u > o: ottanta, momentu, toccà, continentale; a > o: oliva, orechja, ocellu), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general [Corsica](4785)n traits: distinu, ghjinnaghju, sicondu, billezza, apartu, farru, marcuri, cantaraghju, uttanta, mumentu, tuccà, cuntinentale, aliva, arechja, acellu).

Transitional area
Across the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated with either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line are the dialects around Piana and Calcatoggio, from Cinarca with Vizzavona (which form the conditional as in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which have the retroflex ɖ sound (written -dd-) for historical -ll-; along the Southern line, the dialects of [Ajaccio](4710) (retroflex -dd-, realized as -ghj-, feminine plurals ending in i, some Northern words like cane and accattà instead of ghjacaru and cumprà, as well as ellu/ella and not eddu/edda; minor variations: sabbatu > sabbitu, u li dà > ghi lu dà; final syllables often stressed and truncated: marinari > marinà, panatteri > panattè, castellu > castè, cuchjari > cuchjà), the Gravona area, Bastelica (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: Basterga) and Solenzara, which did not preserve the Latin short vowels: seccu, peru, rossu, croci, pozzu.

Southern [Corsica](4785)n
The Southern [Corsica](4785)n macro variety (Suttanacciu, Suttanu, Pumuntincu or Oltramontano) is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sartène and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, the group retains the distinction of the Latin short vowels ĭ and ŭ (e.g. pilu, bucca). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the voiced retroflex stop, like Sicilian (e.g. aceddu, beddu, quiddu, ziteddu, famidda), and the conditional mood formed in -ìa (e.g. (idda) amarìa "she would love"). All the Oltramontani dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, Bastelica, Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around Taravo (retroflex -dd- only for historical -ll-: frateddu, suredda, beddu; preservation of the palatal lateral approximant: piglià, famiglia, figliolu, vogliu; does not preserve the Latin short vowels: seccu, peru, rossu, croci, pozzu), Sartène (preserving the Latin short vowels: siccu, piru, russu, cruci, puzzu; changing historical -rn- to -rr-: forru, carri, corru; substituting the stop for the palatal lateral approximant: piddà, famidda, fiddolu, voddu; imperfect tense like cantàvami, cantàvani; masculine plurals ending in a: l'ochja, i poma; having eddu/edda/eddi as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in [Corsica](4785), being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between the hinterlands of Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio (masculine singulars always ending in u: fiumu, paesu, patronu; masculine plurals always ending in a: i letta, i solda, i ponta, i foca, i mura, i loca, i balcona; imperfect tense like cantàiami, cantàiani).

Sardinia
Sassarese derives from the [Italian language](4701) and, more precisely, from ancient Tuscan, which by the 12th century had slowly grown to become the parlance of the commoners, at a time when the bourgeois and nobles still spoke Logudorese Sardinian. During the age of the Free Commune (1294–1323), the Sassarese dialect was nothing more than a contaminated Pisan, to which Sardinian, [Corsica](4785)n and Spanish expressions had been added; it is therefore not an indigenous dialect, but rather a continental one and, to be more specific, a mixed Tuscan dialect with its own peculiarities, and different from the [Corsica](4785)n-imported Gallurese.
Some Italo-Romance languages that might have originated from Southern [Corsica](4785)n, but are also heavily influenced by the Sardinian language, are spoken in the neighbouring island of Sardinia.
Gallurese is spoken in the extreme north of the island, including the region of Gallura, while Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of Sardinia. Their geographical position in Sardinia has been theorised to be the result of different migration waves from the already tuscanized [Corsica](4785)ns and the Tuscans, who then proceeded to settle in Sardinia and slowly displace the indigenous Logudorese Sardinian varieties spoken therein (at present, Luras is the only town in the middle of Gallura that has retained the original language).
On the Maddalena archipelago, which was culturally [Corsica](4785)n but had been annexed to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia a short while before [Corsica](4785) was ceded by Genoa to France in 1767, the local dialect (called isulanu or maddaleninu) was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio over a long period of immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Southern [Corsica](4785)n. In the dialect of maddalenino, as it is known in Italian, there are also numerous words of Genoese and Ponzese origin.
Although Gallurese and Sassarese both belong to Italo-Dalmatian, which is a group typologically different from Sardinian, it has long been a subject of debate whether the two should be included as dialects either of [Corsica](4785)n or of Sardinian or, in light of their historical development, even considered languages of their own. It has been argued that all these varieties should be placed in a single category, Southern Romance, but such classification has not garnered universal support among linguists.
On 14 October 1997, Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26 of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia granted "the Sassarese and Gallurese dialects" («al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese») equal legal status with the other languages indigenous to Sardinia. Thus, even though they would technically not be covered by the national law pertaining to the historical linguistic minorities, among which is Sardinian, Sassarese and Gallurese are nonetheless recognized by the Sardinian government on a regional level.

Number of speakers
The situation of [Corsica](4785)n with regard to French as the country's national language is analogous to that of many other French regions and provinces, which have or used to have a traditional language of their own, even though the islanders' switch from their local idiom to regional French has happened relatively later and the presence of [Corsica](4785)n, albeit declining, is still strongly felt among the population. In 1980, about 70 percent of the island's population "had some command of the [Corsica](4785)n language." In 1990, out of a total population of about 254,000, the percentage had declined to 50 percent, with 10 percent of the island's residents using it as a first language. The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and initiated some strong measures to save it.
The January 2007 estimated population of [Corsica](4785) was 281,000, whereas the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies—though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article—were performed, was about 261,000. Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke [Corsica](4785)n with any fluency.
According to an official survey run on behalf of the Territorial Collectivity of [Corsica](4785) which took place in April 2013, in [Corsica](4785), the [Corsica](4785)n language had a number of speakers between 86,800 and 130,200, out of a total population amounting to 309,693 inhabitants. 28% of the overall population was able to speak [Corsica](4785)n well, while an additional 14% had a capacity to speak it "quite well." The percentage of those who had a solid oral understanding of the language varies between a minimum of 25 percent in the 25–34 age group and the maximum of 65 percent in the over-65 age group: almost a quarter of the former age group reported that they were not able to understand [Corsica](4785)n, while only a small minority of the older people did not understand it. While 32 percent of the population of Northern [Corsica](4785) was reported to speak [Corsica](4785)n quite well, this percentage dropped to 22 percent for Southern [Corsica](4785). Moreover, 10 percent of the population of [Corsica](4785) spoke only French, while 62 percent code-switched between French and at least some [Corsica](4785)n. 8 percent of the [Corsica](4785)ns knew how to write correctly in [Corsica](4785)n, while about 60 percent of the population did not know how to write in [Corsica](4785)n. While 90 percent of the population was in favor of a [Corsica](4785)n-French bilingualism, 3 percent would have liked to have only [Corsica](4785)n as the official language in the island, and 7 percent would have preferred French to have this role.
UNESCO classifies [Corsica](4785)n as a "definitely endangered language." The [Corsica](4785)n language is a key vehicle for [Corsica](4785)n culture, which is notably rich in proverbs and in polyphonic song.

Governmental support
When the French Assembly passed the Deixonne Law in 1951, which made it possible for regional languages to be taught at school, Alsatian, Flemish and [Corsica](4785)n were not included on the ground of being classified as dialectes allogènes of German, Dutch and Italian respectively, i.e. dialects of foreign languages and not languages in themselves. Only in 1974 were they too politically recognized as regional languages for their teaching on a voluntary basis.
The 1991 Joxe Statute, in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [Corsica](4785)n Assembly, and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of [Corsica](4785)n. The University of [Corsica](4785) Pasquale Paoli at Corte, Haute-Corse took a central role in the planning.
At the primary school level [Corsica](4785)n is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of [Corsica](4785). It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the [Corsica](4785)n Assembly advocates for its use, for example, on public signs.
In 2023, in a judgement initiated by local prefect and going in opposite direction of recent trends, usage of the [Corsica](4785)n language in French public offices and the regional parliament was legally banned, the existence of the "[Corsica](4785)n people" was also deemed unconstitutional.

Literature
According to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern [Corsica](4785)n, known as the Riacquistu, is an integral part of affirming [Corsica](4785)n identity. Some individuals have returned from careers in continental France to write in [Corsica](4785)n, including Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the Teatru Paisanu, which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973–1982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli's Teatru di a Testa Mora, and Saveriu Valentini's Teatru Cupabbia in 1984. Modern prose writers include Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, and Marcu Biancarelli.
There were writers working in [Corsica](4785)n in the 1700s and 1800s.
Ferdinand Gregorovius, a 19th-century traveller and enthusiast of [Corsica](4785)n culture, reported that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the vocero, a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 1700s Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi. However, the trail of written popular literature of known date in [Corsica](4785)n currently goes no further back than the 17th century. An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under External links below). [Corsica](4785)n has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on [Corsica](4785) and many of the churchmen were notaries.
Between 1200 and 1425 the monastery of Gorgona, which belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict for much of that time and was in the territory of Pisa, acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts related to [Corsica](4785). As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with [Corsica](4785)n ones there, the legal language shows a transition from entirely Latin through partially Latin and partially [Corsica](4785)n to entirely [Corsica](4785)n. The first known surviving document containing some [Corsica](4785)n is a bill of sale from Patrimonio dated to 1220. These documents were moved to Pisa before the monastery closed its doors and were published there. Research into earlier evidence of [Corsica](4785)n is ongoing.

Alphabet and spelling
[Corsica](4785)n is written in the standard Latin script, using 21 of the letters for native words. The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs chj, ghj, sc and sg are also defined as "letters" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of ch or ll in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after c, g and s.
The primary diacritic used is the grave accent, indicating word stress when it is not penultimate. In scholarly contexts, disyllables may be distinguished from diphthongs by use of the diaeresis on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the acute accent is sometimes found on stressed ⟨e⟩, the circumflex on stressed ⟨o⟩, indicating respectively (/e/) and (/o/) phonemes.
[Corsica](4785)n has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -u for final -o and the articles u and a for il/lo and la respectively; however, both the dialect of Cap Corse and Gallurese retain the original articles lu and la). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern [Corsica](4785)n dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.

Phonology
Vowels
As in Italian, the grapheme ⟨i⟩ appears in some digraphs and trigraphs in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. ⟨i⟩ is not pronounced between ⟨sc/sg/c/g⟩ and ⟨a/o/u⟩: sciarpa ˈʃarpa; or initially in some words: istu ˈstu
Vowels may be nasalized before ⟨n⟩ (which is assimilated to ⟨m⟩ before ⟨p⟩ or ⟨b⟩) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by ⟨gn⟩. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus ⟨n⟩, ⟨m⟩ or ⟨gn⟩. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: ⟨pane⟩ is pronounced ˈpãnɛ and not ˈpanɛ.
The Northern and central dialects in the vicinity of the Taravo river adopt the Italian seven-vowel system, whereas all the Southern ones around the so-called "archaic zone" with its centre being the town of Sartène (including the Gallurese dialect spoken in Northern Sardinia) resort to a five-vowel system without length differentiation, like Sardinian.
The vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in IPA symbols, is:
