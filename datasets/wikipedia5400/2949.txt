Banana ketchup
[Banana](2900) ketchup, also known as banana sauce (in export markets), is a Philippine fruit ketchup condiment made from banana, sugar, vinegar, and spices. Its natural color is brownish-yellow but it is often dyed red to resemble tomato ketchup. [Banana](2900) ketchup was first produced in the Philippines during World War II due to a wartime shortage of tomatoes but a comparatively high production of bananas.

Use
In Filipino households, this condiment is used on many dishes: Filipino spaghetti, omelettes (torta), hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, fish, charcoal-grilled pork barbecue, chicken skewers, fried chicken, and other meats.

History
Filipina food technologist Maria Y. Orosa (1892â€“1945) is credited with inventing the product.
In 1942, banana ketchup was first mass-produced commercially by Magdalo V. Francisco Sr. who founded the brand name Mafran (a portmanteau of his given name and surname). Francisco sought funding from Tirso T. Reyes to expand his business and therefore the Universal Food Corporation (UFC, now a brand under NutriAsia) was formed in 1969.
