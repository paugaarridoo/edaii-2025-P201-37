BASMAL National Championship
The BASMAL National Championship is the national championship for men's and women's basketball teams in Malawi. It is a tournament that is hosted by the [Basketball](2400) Association of Malawi (BASMAL), and which is typically held over three days in April. Teams from three other leagues in the country, the Central Zone, Northern Zone and Southern Zone leagues participate. In 2022, the men's tournament featured eight teams.
Between 2018 and 2021, the competition was not organised in some years due to a lack of funding and sponsorship.
The winners of each season earn the right to represent Malawi in the Road to BAL.
