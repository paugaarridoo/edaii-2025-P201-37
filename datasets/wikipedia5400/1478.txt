Doesburg
Doesburg (Dutch pronunciation: ˈduzbʏr(ə)x ) is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands in the province of Gelderland. Doesburg received city rights in 1237 and had a population of 11,064 in 2021. The city is situated on the right bank of the River IJssel at its confluence with the River Oude IJssel. It is part of the [Arnhem](1422)-[Nijmegen](1400) Green Metropolitan Region (Dutch: Groene Metropoolregio [Arnhem](1422)-[Nijmegen](1400)), which aids planning and development in the region's eighteen municipalities.

History
Doesburg received city rights in 1237, one year later than the neighbouring town of [Doetinchem](1479). Because of its strategic position along the Oude IJssel and Gelderse IJssel, Doesburg has been an important fortified city for a long time. The fortification of the city made Doesburg an important economic and administrative city. The Martinikerk, the main church in Doesburg, is 94 meters tall. For many reasons, many of which have to do with the IJssel decreasing in depth, the prosperity of Doesburg stagnated after the 15th century. Doesburg became a sleepy provincial town and so it would remain until after the second world war. The city was protected in 1974, designated as a historic town.
As Doesburg was officially a fortified city up to 1923, it could not be expanded. After the second world war the city grew rapidly. In the 1950s, a suburb called Molenveld (English: mill field) was built on the Eastern side of the city. In the 1970s and 1980s a suburb called Beinum was built to the south of the Oude IJssel, and Campstede was subsequently built to the south of Beinum. At the beginning of the 21st century the construction of a new area at the IJsselkade was started with 44 houses and 124 apartments designed by the Italian architect Adolfo Natalini. In 2007, construction of a hotel called "Noabers" was started. After a few months it was insolvent, but was taken over and reopened a year later.

Tourism
In the north of Doesburg there are several camp-sites where in the high season 4000 visitors stay each year. The historical city centre has museums and monuments that draw thousands of tourists every year. Major attractions include the Gildehof, the Doesburgse mustard factory and 'De Waag', possibly the oldest public house in the Netherlands.

Industry
Doesburg has a number of business parks. These include the Verhuellweg on the north side of the city, and  
Beinum-Oost and Beinum-West to the east of the city. Along the Gelderse Ijssel are an iron foundry and a concrete call centre, as well as a builder of motor yachts.
