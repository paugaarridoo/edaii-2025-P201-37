Fragaria pentaphylla
[Fragaria](2850) pentaphylla is a tetraploid species of wild strawberry native to [China](2217). In Chinese, it is called the "five-leaf strawberry" (simplified Chinese: 五叶草莓; traditional Chinese: 五葉草莓; pinyin: wǔyè cǎoméi).

Description
Usually 6–15 cm tall, this species usually blooms around April to May, the fruits are ripe by June. Characteristics include:

Thick leaves with 5 leaflets (2 auxiliary leaflets and 3 terminal leaflets)
Hemispheric fruit, sometimes white (f. alba)
Glabrous above, sparsely hairy beneath
Reflexed petals
Flowers mostly in ones or in pairs- rarely in 3's.

Distribution
[Fragaria](2850) pentaphylla is native to the Chinese provinces of Sichuan Qinghai Gansu Shanxi and Henan. It is most often found on forests, forest clearings, scrub, mountain meadows, and open gravels at elevations of 1000–2700 m.

Cultivation
This species is rare, (if at all) in cultivation.

Commercial value
This plant has little or no commercial value. However, with chromosome doubling, this plant can be bred with [Fragaria](2850) × ananassa, the garden strawberry, possibly introducing new traits, such as disease resistance or new flavors (especially f. alba) to cultivated strawberries.
