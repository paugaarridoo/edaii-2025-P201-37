Banana is a village in Kiribati, located on the island of Kiritimati, within the [Archipelago](1560) of Line Islands. It is located close to Cassidy International Airport.

In 1962, when over 4,000 American servicemen were on the island as part of Operation Dominic, the village became known as Banana for unclear reasons.

Demographics

Social media incident
In 2024, a twitter account (@KiribatiGov) which had successfully impersonated the Kiribati government for some time went viral after responding, "Fine. You're not invited." to a post making fun of the village's name.
