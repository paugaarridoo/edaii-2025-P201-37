Benasquese dialect
Benasquese (autonym: benasqués), often called patués by its speakers, is the native Romance linguistic variety of the Valley of Benasque, in the province of Huesca ([Aragon](2509), Spain). 
Usually regarded as an [Aragon](2509)ese dialect (a particular variety of Ribagorçan, transitional into Catalan, Gascon and [Aragon](2509)ese), it has also been considered an extreme North-Western Catalan dialect in the past by a few linguists, and more recently, a language in its own right. Benasquese itself is often divided into two subdialects, Upper Benasquese and Lower Benasquese.
Although still vigorously spoken (when compared to other [Aragon](2509)ese varieties) by some 1,000 to 2,000 speakers, Benasquese is also in fast decline.
