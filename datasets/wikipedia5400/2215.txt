Cambridgeshire
[Cambridge](2213)shire (abbreviated Cambs.) is a ceremonial county in the East of [England](1990) and East Anglia. It is bordered by Lincolnshire to the north, Norfolk to the north-east, Suffolk to the east, Essex and Hertfordshire to the south, Northamptonshire to the west and Bedfordshire to the south-west. The largest settlement is the city of Peterborough, and the city of [Cambridge](2213) is the county town.
The county has an area of 3,389 km2 (1,309 sq mi) and a population of 852,523. Peterborough and [Cambridge](2213), located in the north-west and south respectively, are by far the largest settlements. The remainder of the county is rural, and contains the city of Ely, and towns such as Wisbech and St Neots.
For local government purposes, [Cambridge](2213)shire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with five districts, and the unitary authority area of Peterborough. The local authorities collaborate through [Cambridge](2213)shire and Peterbrough Combined Authority. The county did not historically include [Huntingdonshire](2252) or the Soke of Peterborough, which was part of Northamptonshire.
The north and east of the county are dominated by the Fens, an extremely flat, drained marsh maintained by drainage ditches and dykes. Holme Fen is the UK's lowest physical point, at 2.75 m (9 ft) below sea level. The flatness of the landscape makes the few areas of higher ground, such as that Ely is built on, very conspicuous. The landscape in the south and west is gently undulating. [Cambridge](2213)shire's principal rivers are the Nene, which flows through the north of the county and is canalised east of Peterborough; the Great Ouse, which flows from west to east past Huntingdon and Ely; and the Cam, a tributary of the Great Ouse which flows through [Cambridge](2213).

History
[Cambridge](2213)shire is noted as the site of Flag Fen in Fengate, one of the earliest-known Neolithic permanent settlements in the United Kingdom, compared in importance to Balbridie in Aberdeen, Scotland. Must Farm quarry, at Whittlesey, has been described as "Britain's Pompeii due to its relatively good condition, including the 'best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings ever found in the UK'". A great quantity of archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age were made in East [Cambridge](2213)shire. Most items were found in Isleham.
The area was settled by the [Anglo-Saxons](1551) starting in the fifth century. Genetic testing on seven skeletons found in Anglo-Saxon era graves in Hinxton and Oakington found that five were either migrants or descended from migrants from the continent, one was a native Briton, and one had both continental and native ancestry, suggesting intermarriage.

[Cambridge](2213)shire was recorded in the Domesday Book as "Grantbridgeshire" (or rather Grentebrigescire) (related to the river Granta). Covering a large part of East Anglia, [Cambridge](2213)shire today is the result of several local government unifications. In 1888 when county councils were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of [Cambridge](2213)shire, for

the area in the south around [Cambridge](2213), and
the liberty of the Isle of Ely.
In 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [Cambridge](2213)shire and the Isle of Ely.
Under the Local Government Act 1972 this merged with the county to the west, Huntingdon and Peterborough, which had been formed in 1965, by the merger of [Huntingdonshire](2252) with the Soke of Peterborough (the latter previously a part of Northamptonshire with its own county council). The resulting county was called simply [Cambridge](2213)shire.
Since 1998, the City of Peterborough has been separately administered as a unitary authority area. It is associated with [Cambridge](2213)shire for ceremonial purposes such as Lieutenancy and joint functions such as policing and the fire service.
In 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife unofficially designated [Cambridge](2213)shire's county flower as the Pasqueflower.
The [Cambridge](2213)shire Regiment (nicknamed the Fen Tigers), the county-based army unit, fought in the Boer War in South Africa, the First World War and Second World War.
Due to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for RAF Bomber Command, RAF Fighter Command, and the allies USAAF. In recognition of this collaboration, the [Cambridge](2213) American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Madingley. It is the only WWII burial ground in [England](1990) for American servicemen who died during that event.
Most English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a "Tyke" from Yorkshire and a "Yellowbelly" from Lincolnshire. The historical nicknames for people from [Cambridge](2213)shire are "[Cambridge](2213)shire Camel" or "[Cambridge](2213)shire Crane", the latter referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the Fens. The term "Fen Tigers" is sometimes used to describe the people who live and work in the Fens.
Original historical documents relating to [Cambridge](2213)shire are held by [Cambridge](2213)shire Archives. [Cambridge](2213)shire County Council Libraries maintains several Local Studies collections of printed and published materials, significantly at the [Cambridge](2213)shire Collection held in the [Cambridge](2213) Central Library.

Flag
[Cambridge](2213)shire's county flag was made official on 1 February 2015, after the design was selected as an entry from a design competition that ran during 2014. The design features three golden crowns, two on the top, one on the bottom that are separated by two wavy lines in the middle. The crowns are meant to represent East Anglia, and the two lines represent the River Cam and are in the [Cambridge](2213) University's colours.

Geography

Large areas of the county are extremely low-lying and Holme Fen is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75 m (9 ft) below sea level. The highest point of the modern administrative county is in the village of Great Chishill at 146 m (480 ft) above sea level. However, this parish was historically a part of Essex, having been moved to [Cambridge](2213)shire in boundary changes in 1895. The historic county top is close to the village of Castle Camps where a point on the disused RAF airfield reaches a height of 128 metres (420 ft) above sea level (grid reference TL 63282 41881).
Other prominent hills are Little Trees Hill and Wandlebury Hill (both at 74 m (243 ft)) in the Gog Magog Hills, Rivey Hill above Linton, Rowley's Hill and the Madingley Hills.

The [Cambridge](2213) Green Belt around the city of [Cambridge](2213) extends to places such as Waterbeach, Lode, Duxford, Little & Great Abington and other communities a few miles away in nearby districts, to afford a protection from the conurbation. It was first drawn up in the 1950s.

Climate
[Cambridge](2213)shire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to [Cambridge](2213)shire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches 25 °C (77 °F) on around ten days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.

Culture
Sports
Various forms of football have been popular in [Cambridge](2213)shire since medieval times at least. In 1579 one match played at Chesterton between townspeople and University of [Cambridge](2213) students ended in a violent brawl that led the Vice-Chancellor to issue a decree forbidding them to play "footeball" outside of college grounds. During the nineteenth century, several formulations of the laws of football, known as the [Cambridge](2213) rules, were created by students at the university.  One of these codes, dating from 1863, had a significant influence on the creation of the original laws of the [Football](2000) Association.
[Cambridge](2213)shire is also the birthplace of bandy, now an IOC accepted sport. According to documents from 1813, Bury Fen [Bandy](1363) Club was undefeated for 100 years.
