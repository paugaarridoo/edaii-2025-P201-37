Brody the Bear
Brody the bear (born January 14, 1995, in Sequim, Washington) was a male Kodiak bear and animal actor.

Background
The bear was raised and trained by his owner, Jeff and the late Leanne Watson, since he was 8 weeks old and weighed less than 10 pounds (4.5 kg). The Watsons acquired Brody from animal trainer and cinematographer Lloyd Beebe who operated the Olympic Game Farm and managed animal actors for Disney. Brody and the Watsons traveled throughout the United States educating the public about bears and safety.
His first television appearance was on Good Morning America at the age of 12 weeks. He appeared in numerous films, television shows, commercials and print ads and appeared on the cover of National Geographic Magazine.
Brody was sponsored by Berne Apparel, a manufacturer of outdoor work apparel, as their live mascot and is pictured in the company's corporate logo and other marketing materials.
