Rowman & Littlefield
Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group is an American independent academic publishing company founded in 1949. Under several imprints, the company offers scholarly books for the academic market, as well as trade books. The company also owns the book distributing company National Book Network based in Lanham, Maryland.

History
The current company took shape when the University Press of America acquired Rowman & Littlefield in 1988 and took the Rowman & Littlefield name for the parent company.
Since 2013, there has also been an affiliated company based in [London](2275) called Rowman & Littlefield International. It is editorially independent and publishes only academic books in Philosophy, Politics & International Relations and Cultural Studies.
The company sponsors the Rowman & Littlefield Award in Innovative Teaching, the only national teaching award in political science given in the [United States](1100). It is awarded annually by the American Political Science Association for people whose innovations have advanced political science pedagogy.
On May 29, 2024, Rowman & Littlefield sold its academic publishing business to Bloomsbury Publishing (with the exception of most of Globe Pequot, the Rowman & Littlefield trade publishing arm, Sundance-Newbridge, the National Book Network, or the company's trade distribution business).
