Alemannic German
[Alemanni](1316)c, or rarely [Alemanni](1316)sh ([Alemanni](1316)sch, alɛˈman(ː)ɪʃ ), is a group of High German dialects. The name derives from the ancient Germanic tribal confederation known as the [Alemanni](1316) ("all men").

Distribution
[Alemanni](1316)c dialects are spoken by approximately ten million people in several countries:

In Europe:
Switzerland: all German-speaking parts of the country except Samnaun
Germany: centre and south of Baden-Württemberg, Swabia, and certain districts of [Bavaria](1377)
[Austria](1585): Vorarlberg, Reutte District of Tyrol
Liechtenstein
France: Alsace region ([Alsatian dialect](4219)) and in some villages of the Phalsbourg county, in Lorraine
Italy: Gressoney-La-Trinité, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Issime, Alagna Valsesia, Rimella and Formazza, in some other villages almost extinct
Outside Europe:
[United States](1100): Allen and Adams County, Indiana, by the Amish there and also in their daughter settlements in Indiana and other U.S. states.
Venezuela: Colonia Tovar (Colonia Tovar dialect)

Status
[Alemanni](1316)c comprises a dialect continuum from the Highest [Alemanni](1316)c spoken in the mountainous south to Swabian in the relatively flat north and more of the characteristics of Standard German the farther north one goes.
In Germany and other European countries, the abstand and ausbau language framework is used to decide what is a language and what is a dialect. According to this framework, [Alemanni](1316)c varieties of German form a dialect continuum and are clearly dialects. Some linguists and organisations that differentiate between languages and dialects primarily on the grounds of mutual intelligibility, such as SIL International and UNESCO, describe [Alemanni](1316)c as one of several independent languages. While ISO 639-2 does not distinguish between dialects, ISO 639-3 distinguishes four of them:

gct – Colonia Tovar, a dialect spoken since 1843 in Venezuela,
gsw – what ISO 639-2 only considers to be the [Alemanni](1316)c language, is recognised here as:
Alsatian, a dialect spoken in the eastern France region;
Swiss German, mainly spoken in Switzerland;
swg – Swabian German, mainly spoken in the central-southeastern Baden-Wuerttemberg,
wae – Walser German, mainly spoken in Swiss Upper Valais in the [Alps](1324).
Standard German is used in writing and in Germany orally in formal contexts throughout the [Alemanni](1316)c-speaking regions (with the exception of Alsace, where French or the [Alsatian dialect](4219) of [Alemanni](1316)c is used instead).

Variants
[Alemanni](1316)c in the broad sense comprises the following variants:

Swabian (mostly in Swabia, in Germany, covering large parts of Württemberg and all of [Bavaria](1377)n Swabia). Unlike most other [Alemanni](1316)c dialects, it does not retain the Middle High German monophthongs û, î but shifts them to ou, ei (as opposed to Standard German aʊ, aɪ). For this reason, "Swabian" is also used in opposition to "[Alemanni](1316)c".
[Alemanni](1316)c in the strict sense:
Low [Alemanni](1316)c dialects. Retain German initial /k/ as kʰ (or kx) rather than fricativising to x as in High [Alemanni](1316)c. Subvariants:
Upper-Rhine [Alemanni](1316)c in Southwestern Baden and its variant Alsatian (in Alsace, France)
Alemán Coloniero (in Venezuela)
[Basel](1372) German (in [Basel](1372), Switzerland)
Lake Constance [Alemanni](1316)c (Bodenseealemannisch) (in Southern Württemberg, Southeastern Baden, Northwestern Vorarlberg), a transitional dialect, close to High [Alemanni](1316)c, with some Swabian features in the vowel system.
High [Alemanni](1316)c (mostly in Switzerland, parts of Vorarlberg, and in the southern parts of the Black Forest in Germany). Complete the High German consonant shift by fricativising initial /k/ to x. Subvariants:
Bernese German
Zurich German
Vorarlbergisch
Liechtensteinisch
Highest [Alemanni](1316)c (in the Canton of Valais, in the Walser settlements (e.g., in the canton of Grisons), in the Bernese Oberland and in the German-speaking part of Fribourg) does not have the hiatus diphthongisation of other dialects of German. For example: ˈʃnei̯jə ('to snow') instead of ˈʃniː.ə(n), ˈb̥ou̯wə ('to build') instead of ˈb̥uː.ə(n). Subvariants:
Walliser German
Walser German
The [Alemanni](1316)c dialects of Switzerland are often called Swiss German or Schwiizerdütsch.

Written [Alemanni](1316)c
The oldest known texts in [Alemanni](1316)c are brief Elder Futhark inscriptions dating to the sixth century (Bülach fibula, Pforzen buckle, Nordendorf fibula). In the Old High German period, the first coherent texts are recorded in the St. Gall Abbey, among them the eighth-century Paternoster:

Fater unser, thu bist in himile
uuihi namu dinan
qhueme rihhi diin
uuerde uuillo diin,
so in himile, sosa in erdu
prooth unseer emezzihic kip uns hiutu
oblaz uns sculdi unsero
so uuir oblazem uns skuldikem
enti ni unsih firleit in khorunka
uzzer losi unsih fona ubile
Due to the importance of the Carolingian abbeys of St. Gall and Reichenau Island, a considerable part of the Old High German corpus has [Alemanni](1316)c traits. [Alemanni](1316)c Middle High German is less prominent, in spite of the Codex Manesse compiled by Johannes Hadlaub of Zürich. The rise of the Old Swiss Confederacy from the fourteenth century led to the creation of [Alemanni](1316)c Swiss chronicles. Huldrych Zwingli's Bible translation of the 1520s (the 1531 Froschauer Bible) was in an [Alemanni](1316)c variant of Early Modern High German. From the seventeenth century, written [Alemanni](1316)c was displaced by Standard German, which emerged from sixteenth century Early Modern High German, in particular in the wake of Martin Luther's Bible translation of the 1520s. The 1665 revision of the Froschauer Bible removed the [Alemanni](1316)c elements, approaching the language used by Luther. For this reason, no binding orthographical standard for writing modern [Alemanni](1316)c emerged, and orthographies in use usually compromise between a precise phonological notation, and proximity to the familiar Standard German orthography (in particular for loanwords).
Johann Peter Hebel published his Allemannische Gedichte in 1803. Swiss authors often consciously employ Helvetisms within Standard German, notably Jeremias Gotthelf in his novels set in the Emmental, Friedrich Glauser in his crime stories, and more recently Tim Krohn in his Quatemberkinder.
The poet Ida Ospelt-Amann wrote and published exclusively in the dialect of Vaduz.

Characteristics
The diminutive is used frequently in all [Alemanni](1316)c dialects. Northern and eastern dialects use the suffix -le; western varieties  (e.g. northern Alsace) uses the suffix -el /l̩/; southern dialects use the suffix -li (Standard German suffix -lein or -chen). As in standard German, these suffixes cause umlaut. Depending on dialect, 'little house' may be Heisle, Hiisel, Hüüsle, Hüüsli or Hiisli (Standard German Häuslein or Häuschen). Some varieties have plural diminutives in -ler, -la or -lich.
Northern variants of [Alemanni](1316)c (Swabian and Low [Alemanni](1316)c), like standard German, pronounce ch as a uvular or velar χ or x (Ach-Laut) after back vowels (a, o, u) and as a palatal ç consonant (Ich-Laut) elsewhere. High [Alemanni](1316)c, Lake Constance [Alemanni](1316)c and Highest [Alemanni](1316)c dialects exclusively use the Ach-Laut.
In most [Alemanni](1316)c dialects, the past participle of the verb meaning to be (sein in standard German, with past participle gewesen) derives from a form akin to gesein (gsi, gsìnn, gsei etc.).
