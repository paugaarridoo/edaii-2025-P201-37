Bernat Metge
Bernat Metge (Catalan pronunciation: bəɾˈnad ˈmedʒə; (c. 1350 – 1410) was a Catalan writer and humanist, best known as the author of Lo Somni, which he wrote from prison (c. 1398), in which Metge discusses the immortality of the soul.
He was a courtier and Secretary for Joan I of Aragon, queen Violant of Bar, and following some troubles, once more served Martin the Humane of Aragon from 1403 to 1410.
His influences included the literature of Provence, Petrarch, and De vetula, wrongly attributed to Ovid and now sometimes claimed for Richard de Fournival.
He had a profound impact on the Catalan letters and was a catalyst for Italian letters to reach the Iberian Peninsula.
