African Games
The [Africa](1700)n Games, formally known as the All-[Africa](1700) Games or the Pan [Africa](1700)n Games, are a continental multi-sport event held every four years, organized by the [Africa](1700)n Union with the  Association of National Olympic Committees of [Africa](1700) and the Association of [Africa](1700)n Sports Confederation.
All of the competing nations are from the [Africa](1700)n continent. The first Games were held in 1965 in Brazzaville, Congo. The International Olympic Committee granted these Games official recognition as a continental multi-sport event, along with the Asian Games and Pan American Games. Since 1999, the Games have also included athletes with a disability.
The Supreme Council for Sport in [Africa](1700) (SCSA) was the organizing body for the Games. On 26 July 2013, the Extraordinary Assembly of the SCSA held in [Abidjan](1733), Ivory Coast on the sidelines of the 5th Session of the [Africa](1700)n Union Conference of Sports Ministers recommended the dissolution of the SCSA and transfer of all its functions, assets & liabilities to the [Africa](1700)n Union Commission. The organization of the [Africa](1700)n Games is now managed by three parts, the AU (the owners of the game), the ANOCA (occupying the technical aspects) and the AASC (developing marketing policy, sponsorship and research resources).
After running previous 11 editions as the All-[Africa](1700) Games, the games has been renamed the [Africa](1700)n Games. The decision for the name change was arrived at, during the Executive Council meeting of the [Africa](1700)n Union held in [Addis Ababa](1742), Ethiopia in January 2012. 54 countries were participating in the most recent edition in Morocco 2019. In 2023, the 13th edition of the game was hosted in [Accra](1738), Ghana. It was aim to use sports for national and continental development, aligning with Ghana's transformative agenda and the [Africa](1700)n Union's Agenda 2063, "[Africa](1700) We Want."

History
Beginning
Modern Olympics founder Pierre de Coubertin conceived the Pan [Africa](1700)n Games as early as 1920. The colonial powers who ruled [Africa](1700) at the time were wary of the idea, suspecting the unifying aspect of sport among [Africa](1700)n people would cause them to assert their independence.
Attempts were made to host the games in Algiers, [Algeria](1317) in 1925 and Alexandria, Egypt in 1928, but despite considerable preparations taken by coordinators, the efforts failed. The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) first [Africa](1700)n member, Greek-born Egyptian sprinter Angelo Bolanaki, donated funds to erect a stadium, but still the Games were set back for another three decades.

The Friendship Games
In the early 1960s, French-speaking countries of [Africa](1700) including France organized the Friendship Games. The Games were organized by Madagascar (1960) and then Ivory Coast (1961). The third games were set for Senegal in 1963. Before they were completed, [Africa](1700)n Ministers of Youth and Sport met in Paris in 1962; as a few English-speaking countries were already participating, they rechristened the Games as the Pan [Africa](1700)n Games. The Games were granted official recognition by the IOC as being on par with other continental Games such as the Asian Games and the Pan American Games.

The games
In July 1965, the first games were held in Brazzaville, Congo, now called the All-[Africa](1700) Games. From 30 countries, around 2,500 athletes competed. Egypt topped the medal count for the first Games.
In 1966, the SCSA was organized in Bamako; it manages the All-[Africa](1700) Games. The second edition were awarded to Mali in 1969, but a military coup forced the cancellation of the Games. Lagos, Nigeria stepped in as host for the Games in 1971. Those Games were finally held in 1973 due to the Biafra War, which had just ended in Nigeria.
In 1977, the 3rd Games were scheduled to take place in [Algeria](1317) but due to technical reasons had to be postponed for a year and were held in 1978. Continuing the pattern, the next Games were scheduled to take place in Kenya in 1983, but were pushed back to 1985 and finally took place in Nairobi in 1987.
The four-year Olympic rhythm has not missed a beat since, and the Games have been organized in Cairo, Harare, Johannesburg, and [Abuja](1737). In 2007, Algiers once again hosted, becoming the first repeat host. The 2011 edition of the All-[Africa](1700) Games was held in Maputo, Mozambique in September 2011. Brazzaville hosted the 2015 edition in honor of the Games' 50th anniversary.

Participation
All 53 members affiliated to the Association of National Olympic Committees of [Africa](1700) (ANOCA) are eligible to take part in the Games. In history, the 53 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) have sent competitors to the Games.
South [Africa](1700) was banned since the beginning of the games in the 1965 All-[Africa](1700) Games till the 1995 All-[Africa](1700) Games because Apartheid officially ended when it was invited for the first time to compete the games.
Morocco was banned from the games from the 1987 All-[Africa](1700) Games to the 2015 [Africa](1700)n Games because of a political dispute over Western Sahara. Morocco claims the territory as its "Southern Provinces" and controls 80% of it while the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which claims to be a sovereign state, controls the remaining 20% as the "Free Zone". In 2018, after the Moroccan government signed its treaty of return to the [Africa](1700)n Union, the country also pledged to return to the [Africa](1700)n Games. Rabat, Morocco hosted the 2019 [Africa](1700)n Games.
