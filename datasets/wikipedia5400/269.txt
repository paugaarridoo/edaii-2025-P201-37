The [Basset](267) Bleu de Gascogne (French pronunciation: bɑsɛ blø də ɡasˈkɔɲ), also known as the Blue Gascony [Basset](267), is a long-backed, short legged breed of dog of the hound type. A French native breed, it is rare outside its homeland. It is recognized internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, in the UK by The Kennel Club, and by the United Kennel Club in the United States. The "bleu" of its name is a reference to its coat which has a ticked appearance.

History
Originating in the Middle Ages, the [Basset](267) Bleu de Gascogne descended directly from the old breed of Grand Bleu de Gascogne. It is thought that Gaston III of Foix-Béarn kept a pack of these dogs to hunt wild boar and wolves. He is known as the writer of the Livre de chasse, considered the classic treatise on medieval hunting.
During the early 19th century the breed nearly became extinct with a declining popularity in hunting. However, the breed was saved and revived by the work of Alain Bourbon.
