Aisha Abd al-Rahman
Aisha Abd al-Rahman ([Arabic](4233): عائشة عبد الرحمن; 18 November 1913 – 1 December 1998) (ʻĀʾishah ʻAbd al-Raḥman) was an Egyptian author, editor and professor of literature who published under the pen name Bint al-Shāṭiʾ Daughter of the Riverbank (بِنْت ٱلشّاطِئ).

Life and career
She was born on 18 November 1913 in Damietta in the governorate of Domyat, Egypt, where her father taught at the Domyat Religious Institute. When she was ten, her mother, though illiterate, enrolled her in school while her father was traveling. Though her father objected, her mother later sent Aisha to El Mansurah for further education. Later, Aisha studied [Arabic](4233) at Cairo University earning her undergraduate degree in 1939, and an M.A. degree in 1941.
In 1942, Aisha began work as an Inspector for teaching of [Arabic](4233) literature for the Egyptian Ministry of Education. She earned her PhD with distinction in 1950 and was appointed Professor of [Arabic](4233) Literature at the University College for Women of the Ain Shams University.
She wrote fiction and biographies of early Muslim women as well as literary criticism. She was the second modern woman to undertake Qur'anic exegesis. She did not consider herself to be a feminist, but her works reflect the belief that female authors are more capable of analyzing the life stories of women than male authors, because men are "ignorant of female instinct".
During her lifetime, ʻĀʾishah ʻAbd al-Raḥman was recognised for her achievements, which earned her several awards. In 1987, she received the State Award from the Egyptian government. In 1994, she was the co-winner-along with Widād Al-Qāḍī- of King Faisal International Award for [Arabic](4233) Literature. 
She was married to Sheik Amin al-Khuli, her teacher at Cairo University during her undergraduate years. She died of a heart attack following a stroke in Cairo. She donated all her library to research purposes, and in 1985 a statue was built in her honor in Cairo.
