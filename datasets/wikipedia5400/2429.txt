The ASEAN [Basketball](2400) League (ABL) was an international professional men's basketball league in Southeast Asia, composed of eight teams from Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), in addition to Hong Kong and Macau. Earlier teams have included Taiwan and Brunei. The league was proposed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and launched its inaugural season on 1 October 2009.

History
Formation
[Basketball](2400) officials from 6 ASEAN nations gathered in Metro Manila on 1 September 2009 to officially launch the new league. In its inaugural season, there were six participating teams from different nations in Southeast Asia:

League expansion
On 22 September 2011, the Brunei Barracudas announced that they were bowing out of the third season of ABL after participating for 2 seasons. On 20 October 2011, the Saigon Sports Academy officially announced the participation of Saigon Heat into the third season of ABL, making them the first ever international professional basketball team to represent Vietnam. In the same season, San Miguel Beermen and Bangkok Cobras joined the league along with Saigon Heat. Unfortunately, the Beermen left the ABL after winning the title in 2013. The Cobras also left the league after one season. Further, in 2014, Laskar Dreya South Sumatra (INA) joined and played for a season.
In 2015, Pilipinas MX3 Kings and Mono Vampire joined the league and both teams left in 2016. On 17 July 2016, Kaohsiung Truth from Kaohsiung, Taiwan announced that they will participate in the 2016–17 season. In the same year, the Eastern [Basketball](2400) Club confirmed its participation in the league. The two teams were the first teams from outside Southeast Asia to compete in the league. The Philippines returned in the league with Alab Pilipinas on 6 August 2016. In September 2017, ABL confirmed four new teams for the 2017–18 season: CLS Knights Indonesia, Formosa Dreamers, the returning Mono Vampire [Basketball](2400) Club, and the Nanhai Kung Fu after the Kaoshiung Truth disbanded after the seventh season of ABL.
After the 2018 season, the Kung Fu moved to Macau and became the Macau Black Bears, while the league announced the addition of the Zhuhai Wolf Warriors, based in Zhuhai in the Pearl River delta. On 9 September 2019, the league confirmed the entry of the third team from Taiwan, Taipei Fubon Braves situated in Taipei after Formosa Dreamers and disbanded Kaohsiung Truth. Fubon Braves secured the best record in the Super [Basketball](2400) League and capped it off with the SBL championship after sweeping the Finals series in four games. They are also one of the eight teams to compete in the 2019 FIBA Asia Champions Cup.

COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty
The 2019–20 ABL season was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, placing the status of the ABL in uncertainty. The withdrawal of Mono Vampires, the reports of Taiwanese teams planning to join a domestic league, and the inactivity of the league's social media were among the factors that fueled speculations that the ABL itself would fold. However, an ABL co-owner dispelled such rumors, stating that they plan to hold the eleventh season in 2021. Plans to resume the league were postponed again with the new starting date for the season initially being in February 2022. The start date was pushed back again a month later to September. The plan did not proceed, but in October the ABL announced its return.
An invitational tournament was held in 2023 and won by Hong Kong Eastern. On November 20, 2023, the league's uncertainty continued as FIBA had dropped support for the ABL. It is "unlikely to play for the foreseeable future", from statement made by the Singapore Slingers.
