Before independence
It wasn't until 1963 that the Portuguese national basketball championship began to include clubs from the províncias ultramarinas (overseas provinces) of [Angola](1855) and Mozambique. This new format began with one team from each of the three locations and then changed to two teams from the host and one from each of the remaining two locations, who played a round-robin (then double round-robin) tournament to determine the champion of Portugal, with the championship taking place alternatively at each of the three capitals: Luanda ([Angola](1855)), Lourenço Marques (Mozambique) and Lisbon/Porto (Portugal). From 1963 to 1974, 12 championships were held, with only one [Angola](1855)n club succeeding to win the championship: Benfica de Luanda in 1967
