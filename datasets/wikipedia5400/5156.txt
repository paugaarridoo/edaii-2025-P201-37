Alhamdulillah
Alhamdulillah ([Arabic](4233): ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, al-Ḥamdu lillāh) is an [Arabic](4233) phrase meaning "praise be to God", sometimes translated as "thank God" or "thanks be to the Lord". This phrase is called Tahmid ([Arabic](4233): تَحْمِيد, lit. 'Praising'). A longer variant of the phrase is al-ḥamdu l-illāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn (ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ), meaning "all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds", the first verse of Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Quran.
The phrase is frequently used by Muslims of every background due to its centrality in the texts of the Quran and Hadith, the words of the [Islam](5101)ic prophet Muhammad. Its meaning and in-depth explanation have been the subject of much exegesis. It is also commonly used by non-Muslim speakers of the [Arabic](4233) language.

Meaning
The phrase has three basic parts:

al-, the definite article, "the".
ḥamd(u), literally meaning "praise", "commendation".
li-llāh(i), preposition + noun [Allāh](5163). Li- is a dative preposition meaning "to". The word [Allāh](5163) ([Arabic](4233): ٱللَّٰه) is the proper name of the God of [Abraham](1735). "Al ilah" means "The God", and it is a contraction of the definite article al- and the word ʾilāh ([Arabic](4233): إِلَٰه, "god, deity"). As in English, the article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, "the God" (the one and only) or "God". Therefore, [Allāh](5163) is the [Arabic](4233) word for "God". ʾilāh is the [Arabic](4233) cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El.
The phrase is first found in the first verse of the first sura of the Qur'an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and [Arabic](4233)-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb hamdala ([Arabic](4233): حَمْدَلَ), "to say al-ḥamdu li-llāh" was coined, and the derived noun ḥamdala is used as a name for this phrase.
The triconsonantal root Ḥ-M-D ([Arabic](4233): ح م د), meaning "praise", can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad, among others.
