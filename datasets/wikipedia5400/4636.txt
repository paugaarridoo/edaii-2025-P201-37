Languages of Asia
[Asia](1914) is home to hundreds of languages comprising several families and some unrelated isolates. The most spoken language families on the continent include Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Japonic, Dravidian, Indo-European, Afroasiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, Kra–Dai and Koreanic. Many languages of [Asia](1914), such as Chinese, Persian, Sanskrit, [Arabic](4233), Tamil or Telugu, have a long history as a written language.

Language groups
The major families in terms of numbers are Indo-European, specifically Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages in South [Asia](1914); and Sino-Tibetan in East [Asia](1914). Several other families are regionally dominant.

Sino-Tibetan
Sino-Tibetan includes Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese, Karen, Boro and numerous languages of the Tibetan Plateau, Southern [China](2217), Burma, and North East [India](2798).

Indo-European
The Indo-European languages are primarily represented in [Asia](1914) by the Indo-Iranian branch, with its two main subgroups: Indo-Aryan and Indo-Iranian.
Indo-Aryan languages are mainly spoken in South [Asia](1914). Examples include languages such as Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Marathi, Rajasthani, Gujarati,  Sylheti)
Iranic languages are mainly spoken in Iran, [Afghanistan](1312) and Pakistan and neighboring regions. Examples include languages like Persian, Kurdish, Pashto and Balochi which are spoken in
In addition, other branches of Indo-European spoken in [Asia](1914) include the Slavic branch, which includes Russian in Siberia; Greek around the [Black Sea](1694); and [Armenia](1567)n; as well as extinct languages such as Hittite of Anatolia and Tocharian of (Chinese) Turkestan.

Altaic families
A number of smaller, but important and separately distinguished language families spread across central and northern [Asia](1914) have long been linked in a hypothetical, controversial and unproven Altaic family. These are the Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic (including Manchu), Koreanic, and Japonic languages. But since the mid-20th century a majority of scholars have come to regard it as a Sprachbund.

Austroasiatic
The Mon–Khmer languages (also known as Austroasiatic) are the language family in South and Southeast [Asia](1914). Languages given official status are Vietnamese and Khmer ([Cambodia](4671)n).

Kra–Dai
The Kra–Dai languages (also known as Tai-Kadai) are found in southern [China](2217), Northeast [India](2798) and Southeast [Asia](1914). Languages given official status are Thai (Siamese) and Lao.

Austronesian
The [Austronesian languages](2925) are widespread throughout Maritime Southeast [Asia](1914), including major languages such as Fijian (Fiji), Hiligaynon, Bikol, Ilocano, Cebuano, Tagalog (Philippines), and Malay (Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore). Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese of Indonesia, as well as Indonesian, which is the largest language in this family.

Dravidian
The Dravidian languages of South [India](2798) and parts of Sri Lanka include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Tulu, while smaller languages such as Gondi and Brahui are spoken in central [India](2798) and Pakistan respectively.

[Afro-[Asia](1914)tic](1789)
The [Afroasiatic languages](1791) (in older sources Hamito-Semitic) are represented in [Asia](1914) by the Semitic branch. Semitic languages are spoken in Western [Asia](1914), and include [Arabic](4233), Hebrew and Aramaic, in addition to extinct languages such as Akkadian.

Siberian families
Besides the Altaic families already mentioned (of which Tungusic is today a minor family of Siberia), there are a number of small language families and isolates spoken across northern [Asia](1914). These include the Uralic languages of western Siberia (better known for Hungarian and Finnish in Europe), the Yeniseian languages (linked to Turkic and to the Athabaskan languages of North America), Yukaghir, Nivkh of Sakhalin, Ainu of northern Japan, Chukotko-Kamchatkan in easternmost Siberia, and—just barely—Eskimo–Aleut. Some linguists have noted that the Koreanic languages share more similarities with the Paleosiberian languages than with the Altaic languages. The extinct Rouran language of Mongolia is unclassified, and does not show genetic relationships with any other known language family.

Caucasian families
Three small families are spoken in the Caucasus: Kartvelian languages, such as Georgian; Northeast Caucasian (Dagestanian languages), such as Chechen; and Northwest Caucasian, such as Circassian. The latter two may be related to each other. The extinct Hurro-Urartian languages may be related as well.

Small families of [Asia](1914)
Although dominated by major languages and families, there are number of minor families and isolates in South [Asia](1914) and Southeast [Asia](1914). From west to east, these include:

Hattic, an unclassified language in Anatolia.
extinct languages of the Fertile Crescent such as Sumerian and Elamite.
extinct languages of South [Asia](1914); mainly the unclassified Harappan language
small language families and isolates of the [India](2798)n subcontinent: Burushaski, Kusunda, and Nihali. The Vedda language of Sri Lanka is likely an isolate that has mixed with Sinhala.
the two Andamanese language families: Great Andamanese and Ongan; Sentinelese remains undocumented to date, and hence unclassified.
unclassified languages in Southeast [Asia](1914): Kenaboi.
the difficult to classify Arunachal languages: Digaro, Hrusish (including the Miji languages), Midzu, Puroik, Siangic, and Kho-Bwa.
Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) scattered across southern [China](2217) and Southeast [Asia](1914)
a few "Papuan" (Non-Austronesian) families of the central and eastern Malay [Archipelago](1560): such as the Timor-Alor-Pantar and North Halmahera languages, and the little known extinct Tambora language of Sumbawa. Numerous additional families are spoken in Indonesian New Guinea, which is generally considered to part of Oceania.

Creoles and pidgins
The eponymous pidgin ("business") language developed with European trade in [China](2217). Of the many creoles to have developed, the most spoken today are [Chavacano](4400), a Spanish-based creole of the Philippines, and various Malay-based creoles such as Manado Malay influenced by Portuguese. A very well-known Portuguese-based creole is the Kristang, which is spoken in Malacca, a city-state in Malaysia.

Sign languages
A number of sign languages are spoken throughout [Asia](1914). These include the Japanese Sign Language family, Chinese Sign Language, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language, as well as a number of small indigenous sign languages of countries such as Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Many official sign languages are part of the French Sign Language family.

Official languages
[Asia](1914) and Europe are the only two continents where most countries use native languages as their official languages, though English is also widespread as an international language.
