Buenaventura Carlos Aribau
Bonaventura Carles Aribau i Farriols (1798–1862) was a Catalan economist, stenographer, writer and politician who wrote in Spanish, Catalan, Latin, and Italian.

Biography
With an enormous intellectual curiosity, he studied rhetoric and poetry at the Conciliar Seminary. He did not finish his studies of hydrostatics, statics and experimental physics at the Junta de Comerç, due to serious family problems. As a young man, he was one of the founders of the Societat Filosòfica in 1815, and published Ensayos poéticos.
In 1820, he enthusiastically participated in the revolution that initiated Riego's Liberal Triennium. At the same time, he collaborated with the Diario Constitucional (Constitutional Newspaper) and began his career in journalism, and also started in politics by becoming secretary of the Diputació de Lleida (1823). At that time he joined the Academy of Fine Arts (1820) and in 1823 he was one of the co-founders and editors of El Europeo, the first great Catalan project of romantic journalism. In this sense, it is considered that he was influenced by the Italian romantic writer Alessandro Manzoni, who founded the magazine Conciliatore. Aribau, moreover, suggested to his friend Juan Nicasio Gallego to translate Manzoni into Spanish. Aribau also shared a friendship with the writer and lawyer Ramon Muns i Serinyà.
