Albanian language
[Albania](1534)n (endonym: shqip ʃcip , gjuha shqipe ˈɟuha ˈʃcipɛ, or arbërisht aɾbəˈɾiʃt) is an Indo-[Europe](1994)an language and the only surviving representative of the Albanoid branch, which belongs to the Paleo-Balkan group. It is the native language of the [Albania](1534)n people. Standard [Albania](1534)n is the official language of [Albania](1534) and Kosovo, and a co-official language in North Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as a recognized minority language of Italy, Croatia, Romania and Serbia. It is also spoken in Greece and by the [Albania](1534)n diaspora, which is generally concentrated in the [Americas](3978), [Europe](1994) and Oceania. [Albania](1534)n is estimated to have as many as 7.5 million native speakers.
[Albania](1534)n and other Paleo-Balkan languages had their formative core in the Balkans after the Indo-[Europe](1994)an migrations in the region. [Albania](1534)n in antiquity is often thought to have been an Illyrian language for obvious geographic and historical reasons, or otherwise an unmentioned Balkan Indo-[Europe](1994)an language that was closely related to Illyrian and Messapic. The Indo-[Europe](1994)an subfamily that gave rise to [Albania](1534)n is called Albanoid in reference to a specific ethnolinguistically pertinent and historically compact language group. Whether descendants or sisters of what was called 'Illyrian' by classical sources, [Albania](1534)n and Messapic, on the basis of shared features and innovations, are grouped together in a common branch in the current phylogenetic classification of the Indo-[Europe](1994)an language family.
The first written mention of [Albania](1534)n was in 1284 in a witness testimony from the Republic of Ragusa, while a letter written by Dominican Friar Gulielmus Adea in 1332 mentions the [Albania](1534)ns using the Latin alphabet in their writings. The oldest surviving attestation of modern [Albania](1534)n is from 1462. The two main [Albania](1534)n dialect groups (or varieties), Gheg and Tosk, are primarily distinguished by phonological differences and are mutually intelligible in their standard varieties, with Gheg spoken to the north and Tosk spoken to the south of the Shkumbin river. Their characteristics in the treatment of both native words and loanwords provide evidence that the split into the northern and the southern dialects occurred after Christianisation of the region (4th century AD), and most likely not later than the 6th century AD, hence possibly occupying roughly their present area divided by the Shkumbin river since the Post-Roman and Pre-Slavic period, straddling the Jireček Line.
Centuries-old communities speaking [Albania](1534)n dialects can be found scattered in Greece (the Arvanites and some communities in Epirus, Western Macedonia and Western Thrace), Croatia (the Arbanasi), Italy (the Arbëreshë) as well as in Romania, Turkey and Ukraine. The Malsia e Madhe Gheg [Albania](1534)n and two varieties of the Tosk dialect, Arvanitika in Greece and Arbëresh in southern Italy, have preserved archaic elements of the language. Ethnic [Albania](1534)ns constitute a large diaspora, with many having long assimilated in different cultures and communities. Consequently, [Albania](1534)n-speakers do not correspond to the total ethnic [Albania](1534)n population, as many ethnic [Albania](1534)ns may identify as [Albania](1534)n but are unable to speak the language.
Standard [Albania](1534)n is a standardised form of spoken [Albania](1534)n based on Tosk.

Geographic distribution
The language is spoken by approximately 6 million people in the Balkans, primarily in [Albania](1534), Kosovo, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. However, due to old communities in Italy and the large [Albania](1534)n diaspora, the worldwide total of speakers is much higher than in Southern [Europe](1994) and numbers approximately 7.5 million.

[Europe](1994)
The [Albania](1534)n language is the official language of [Albania](1534) and Kosovo and a co-official language in North Macedonia and Montenegro. [Albania](1534)n is a recognised minority language in Croatia, Italy, Romania and in Serbia. [Albania](1534)n is also spoken by a minority in Greece, specifically in the Thesprotia and Preveza regional units and in a few villages in Ioannina and Florina regional units in Greece. It is also spoken by 450,000 [Albania](1534)n immigrants in Greece, making it one of the commonly spoken languages in the country after Greek.
[Albania](1534)n is the third most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy. This is due to a substantial [Albania](1534)n immigration to Italy. Italy has a historical [Albania](1534)n minority of about 500,000, scattered across southern Italy, known as Arbëreshë. Approximately 1 million [Albania](1534)ns from Kosovo are dispersed throughout Germany, Switzerland and [Austria](1585). These are mainly immigrants from Kosovo who migrated during the 1990s. In Switzerland, the [Albania](1534)n language is the sixth most spoken language with 176,293 native speakers.
[Albania](1534)n became an official language in North Macedonia on 15 January 2019.

[Americas](3978)
There are large numbers of [Albania](1534)n speakers in the United States, [Argentina](1862), Chile, Uruguay, and Canada. Some of the first ethnic [Albania](1534)ns to arrive in the United States were the Arbëreshë. The Arbëreshë have a strong sense of identity and are unique in that they speak an archaic dialect of Tosk [Albania](1534)n called Arbëresh.
In the United States and Canada, there are approximately 250,000 [Albania](1534)n speakers. It is primarily spoken on the East Coast of the United States, in cities like New York City, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Detroit, as well as in parts of the states of New Jersey, Ohio, and Connecticut.
In [Argentina](1862), there are nearly 40,000 [Albania](1534)n speakers, mostly in Buenos Aires.

Asia and Africa
Approximately 1.3 million people of [Albania](1534)n ancestry live in Turkey, with more than 500,000 recognizing their ancestry, language and culture. There are other estimates, however, that place the number of people in Turkey with [Albania](1534)n ancestry and or background upward to 5 million. However, the vast majority of this population is assimilated and no longer possesses fluency in the [Albania](1534)n language, though a vibrant [Albania](1534)n community maintains its distinct identity in Istanbul to this day.
[Egypt](1987) also lays claim to about 18,000 [Albania](1534)ns, mostly Tosk speakers. Many are descendants of the Janissary of Muhammad Ali Pasha, an [Albania](1534)n who became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of [Egypt](1987) and Sudan. In addition to the dynasty that he established, a large part of the former [Egypt](1987)ian and Sudanese aristocracy was of [Albania](1534)n origin. In addition to the recent emigrants, there are older diasporic communities around the world.

Oceania
[Albania](1534)n is also spoken by [Albania](1534)n diaspora communities residing in [Australia](1659) and New Zealand.

Dialects
The [Albania](1534)n language has two distinct dialects, Tosk which is spoken in the south, and Gheg spoken in the north. Standard [Albania](1534)n is based on the Tosk dialect. The Shkumbin River is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.
Gheg is divided into four sub-dialects: Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg and Southern Gheg. It is primarily spoken in northern [Albania](1534), Kosovo, and throughout Montenegro and northwestern North Macedonia. One fairly divergent dialect is the Upper Reka dialect, which is however classified as Central Gheg. There is also a diaspora dialect in Croatia, the Arbanasi dialect.
Tosk is divided into five sub-dialects, including Northern Tosk (the most numerous in speakers), Labërisht, Cham, Arvanitika, and Arbëresh. Tosk is spoken in southern [Albania](1534), southwestern North Macedonia and northern and southern Greece. Cham [Albania](1534)n is spoken in North-western Greece, while Arvanitika is spoken by the Arvanites in southern Greece. In addition, Arbëresh is spoken by the Arbëreshë people, descendants of 15th and 16th century migrants who settled in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of Sicily and Calabria. These settlements originated from the (Arvanites) communities probably of Peloponnese known as Morea in the Middle Ages. Among them the Arvanites call themselves Arbëror and sometime Arbëresh. The Arbëresh dialect is closely related to the Arvanites dialect with more Italian vocabulary absorbed during different periods of time.

Orthography
The [Albania](1534)n language has been written using many alphabets since the earliest records from the 15th century. The history of [Albania](1534)n language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among [Albania](1534)n writers. The earliest written [Albania](1534)n records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the Greek alphabet and the Gheg dialect was written in the Latin script. Both dialects had also been written in the Ottoman Turkish version of the Arabic script, Cyrillic, and some local alphabets (Elbasan, Vithkuqi, Todhri, Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see original [Albania](1534)n alphabets). More specifically, the writers from northern [Albania](1534) and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern [Albania](1534) and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout [Albania](1534) and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original [Albania](1534)n alphabet during the 1750–1850 period. These attempts intensified after the League of Prizren and culminated with the Congress of Manastir held by [Albania](1534)n intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day Bitola), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardised spelling would be for standard [Albania](1534)n. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters ⟨ë⟩, ⟨ç⟩, and ten digraphs: dh, th, xh, gj, nj, ng, ll, rr, zh and sh.
According to Robert Elsie:

The hundred years between 1750 and 1850 were an age of astounding orthographic diversity in [Albania](1534). In this period, the [Albania](1534)n language was put to writing in at least ten different alphabets – most certainly a record for [Europe](1994)an languages. ... the diverse forms in which this old Balkan language was recorded, from the earliest documents to the beginning of the twentieth century ... consist of adaptations of the Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets and (what is even more interesting) a number of locally invented writing systems. Most of the latter alphabets have now been forgotten and are unknown, even to the [Albania](1534)ns themselves.

Classification
[Albania](1534)n constitutes one of the eleven major branches of the Indo-[Europe](1994)an language family, within which it occupies an independent position. In 1854, [Albania](1534)n was demonstrated to be an Indo-[Europe](1994)an language by the philologist Franz Bopp. [Albania](1534)n was formerly compared by a few Indo-[Europe](1994)an linguists with Germanic and Balto-Slavic, all of which share a number of isoglosses with [Albania](1534)n. Other linguists linked the [Albania](1534)n language with Latin, Greek and Armenian, while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-[Europe](1994)an. In current scholarship there is evidence that [Albania](1534)n is closely related to Greek and Armenian, while the fact that it is a satem language is less significant.

Messapic is considered the closest language to [Albania](1534)n, grouped in a common branch titled Illyric in Hyllested & Joseph (2022). Hyllested & Joseph (2022) in agreement with recent bibliography identify Greco-Phrygian as the IE branch closest to the [Albania](1534)n-Messapic one. These two branches form an areal grouping – which is often called "Balkan IE" – with Armenian. The hypothesis of the "Balkan Indo-[Europe](1994)an" continuum posits a common period of prehistoric coexistence of several Indo-[Europe](1994)an dialects in the Balkans prior to 2000 BC. To this group would belong [Albania](1534)n, [Ancient Greek](3061), Armenian, Phrygian, fragmentary attested languages such as Macedonian, Thracian, or Illyrian, and the relatively well-attested Messapic in Southern Italy. The common features of this group appear at the phonological, morphological, and lexical levels, presumably resulting from the contact between the various languages. The concept of this linguistic group is explained as a kind of language league of the Bronze Age (a specific areal-linguistics phenomenon), although it also consisted of languages that were related to each other. A common prestage posterior to PIE comprising [Albania](1534)n, Greek, and Armenian, is considered as a possible scenario. In this light, due to the larger number of possible shared innovations between Greek and Armenian, it appears reasonable to assume, at least tentatively, that [Albania](1534)n was the first Balkan IE language to branch off. This split and the following ones were perhaps very close in time, allowing only a narrow time frame for shared innovations.
[Albania](1534)n represents one of the core languages of the Balkan Sprachbund.
Glottolog and Ethnologue recognize four [Albania](1534)n languages. They are classified as follows:

History
Historical documentation
The first attested written mention of the [Albania](1534)n language was on 14 July 1284 in Ragusa in modern Croatia (Dubrovnik) when a crime witness named Matthew testified: "I heard a voice crying on the mountain in the [Albania](1534)n language" (Latin: Audivi unam vocem, clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca).

The [Albania](1534)n language is also mentioned in the Descriptio Europae Orientalis dated in 1308:Habent enim Albani prefati linguam distinctam a Latinis, Grecis et Sclauis ita quod in nullo se intelligunt cum aliis nationibus.
(Namely, the above-mentioned [Albania](1534)ns have a language that is different from the languages of Latins, Greeks and Slavs, so that they do not understand each other at all.)The oldest attested document written in [Albania](1534)n dates to 1462, while the first audio recording in the language was made by Norbert Jokl on 4 April 1914 in Vienna.
However, as Fortson notes, [Albania](1534)n written works existed before this point; they have simply been lost. The existence of written [Albania](1534)n is explicitly mentioned in a letter attested from 1332, and the first preserved books, including both those in Gheg and in Tosk, share orthographic features that indicate that some form of common literary language had developed.
By the Late Middle Ages, during the period of Humanism and the [Europe](1994)an Renaissance, the term lingua epirotica 'Epirotan language' was preferred in the intellectual, literary, and clerical circles of the time, and used as a synonym for the [Albania](1534)n language. Published in Rome in 1635, by the [Albania](1534)n bishop and writer Frang Bardhi, the first dictionary of the [Albania](1534)n language was titled Latin: Dictionarium latino-epiroticum 'Latin-Epirotan dictionary'.
During the five-century period of the Ottoman presence in [Albania](1534), the language was not officially recognised until 1909, when the Congress of Dibra decided that [Albania](1534)n schools would finally be allowed.

Linguistic affinities
[Albania](1534)n is an isolate within the Indo-[Europe](1994)an language family; no other language has been conclusively linked to its branch. The only other languages that are the sole surviving members of a branch of Indo-[Europe](1994)an are Armenian and Greek.
The [Albania](1534)n language is part of the Indo-[Europe](1994)an language family and the only surviving representative of its own branch, which belongs to the Paleo-Balkan group. Although it is still uncertain which ancient mentioned language of the Balkans it continues, or where in the region its speakers lived. In general, there is insufficient evidence to connect [Albania](1534)n with one of those languages, whether Illyrian, Thracian, or Dacian.Among these possibilities, Illyrian is the most probable.
Although [Albania](1534)n shares lexical isoglosses with Greek, Germanic, and to a lesser extent Balto-Slavic, the vocabulary of [Albania](1534)n is quite distinct. In 1995, Taylor, Ringe, and Warnow used quantitative linguistic techniques that appeared to obtain an [Albania](1534)n subgrouping with Germanic, a result which the authors had already reasonably downplayed. Indeed, the [Albania](1534)n and Germanic branches share a relatively moderate number of lexical cognates. Many shared grammatical elements or features of these two branches do not corroborate the lexical isoglosses. [Albania](1534)n also shares lexical linguistic affinity with Latin and Romance languages. Sharing linguistic features unique to the languages of the Balkans, [Albania](1534)n also forms a part of the Balkan linguistic area or sprachbund.

Historical presence and location
The place and the time that the [Albania](1534)n language was formed are uncertain. The American linguist Eric Hamp has said that during an unknown chronological period a pre-[Albania](1534)n population (termed as "Albanoid" by Hamp) inhabited areas stretching from Poland to the southwestern Balkans. Further analysis has suggested that it was in a mountainous region rather than on a plain or seacoast. The words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, but the names for fish and for agricultural activities (such as ploughing) are borrowed from other languages.
A deeper analysis of the vocabulary, however, shows that could be a consequence of a prolonged Latin domination of the coastal and plain areas of the country, rather than evidence of the original environment in which the [Albania](1534)n language was formed. For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills' which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft', 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row' and 'harbor'; objects pertaining to navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-[Albania](1534)ns were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) and thus lost a large amount (or the majority) of their sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', 'cattle breeding', etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign. This, again, points to intense contact with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible linguistic homeland (also known as a Urheimat).

The centre of [Albania](1534)n settlement remained the Mat River. In 1079, the [Albania](1534)ns were recorded farther south in the valley of the Shkumbin River. The Shkumbin, a 181 km long river that lies near the old Via Egnatia, is approximately the boundary of the primary dialect division for [Albania](1534)n, Tosk and Gheg. The characteristics of Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native words and loanwords from other languages are evidence that the dialectal split preceded the Slavic migrations to the Balkans, which means that in that period (the 5th to 6th centuries AD), [Albania](1534)ns were occupying nearly the same area around the Shkumbin river, which straddled the Jireček Line.
References to the existence of [Albania](1534)n as a distinct language survive from the 14th century, but they failed to cite specific words. The oldest surviving documents written in [Albania](1534)n are the "formula e pagëzimit" (Baptismal formula), Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit. ("I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit") recorded by Pal Engjelli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some New Testament verses from that period.
The linguists Stefan Schumacher and Joachim Matzinger (University of Vienna) assert that the first literary records of [Albania](1534)n date from the 16th century. The oldest known [Albania](1534)n printed book, Meshari, or "missal", was written in 1555 by Gjon Buzuku, a Roman Catholic cleric. In 1635, Frang Bardhi wrote the first Latin–[Albania](1534)n dictionary. The first [Albania](1534)n school is believed to have been opened by Franciscans in 1638 in Pdhanë.
One of the earliest [Albania](1534)n dictionaries was written in 1693; it was the Italian manuscript Pratichae Schrivaneschae authored by the Montenegrin sea captain Julije Balović and includes a multilingual dictionary of hundreds of the most frequently used words in everyday life in Italian, Slavic, Greek, [Albania](1534)n, and Turkish.

Pre-Indo-[Europe](1994)an substratum
Pre-Indo-[Europe](1994)an (PreIE) sites are found throughout the territory of [Albania](1534). Such PreIE sites existed in Maliq, Vashtëmi, Burimas, Barç, Dërsnik in the Korçë District, Kamnik in Kolonja, Kolsh in the Kukës District, Rashtan in Librazhd, and Nezir in the Mat District. As in other parts of [Europe](1994), these PreIE people joined the migratory Indo-[Europe](1994)an tribes that entered the Balkans and contributed to the formation of the historical Paleo-Balkan tribes. In terms of linguistics, the pre-Indo-[Europe](1994)an substrate language spoken in the southern Balkans probably influenced pre-Proto-[Albania](1534)n, the ancestor idiom of [Albania](1534)n. The extent of this linguistic impact cannot be determined with precision due to the uncertain position of [Albania](1534)n among Paleo-Balkan languages and their scarce attestation. Some loanwords, however, have been proposed, such as shegë 'pomegranate' or lëpjetë 'orach'; compare Pre-Greek λάπαθον, lápathon 'monk's rhubarb'.

Literary tradition
Earliest undisputed texts
The earliest known texts in [Albania](1534)n:

the formula e pagëzimit (Baptismal Formula), which dates back to 1462 and was authored by Pal Engjëlli (or Paulus Angelus) (c. 1417 – 1470), Archbishop of Durrës. Engjëlli was a close friend and counsellor of Skanderbeg. It was written in a pastoral letter for a synod at the Holy Trinity in Mat and read in Latin characters as follows: Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et Spertit Senit (standard [Albania](1534)n: Unë të pagëzoj në emër të Atit, të Birit e të Shpirtit të Shenjtë; English: "I baptise you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit"). It was discovered and published in 1915 by Nicolae Iorga.
the Fjalori i Arnold von Harfit (Arnold Ritter von Harff's lexicon), a short list of [Albania](1534)n phrases with German glosses, dated 1496.
a song, recorded in the Greek alphabet, retrieved from an old codex that was written in Greek. The document is also called Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Pashkëve or Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Shën Mateut ("The Song of the Easter Gospel, or "The Song of Saint Matthew's Gospel"). Although the codex is dated to during the 14th century, the song, written in [Albania](1534)n by an anonymous writer, seems to be a 16th-century writing. The document was found by Arbëreshë people who had emigrated to Italy in the 15th century.
The first book in [Albania](1534)n is the Meshari ("The Missal"), written by Gjon Buzuku between 20 March 1554 and 5 January 1555. The book was written in the Gheg dialect in the Latin script with some Slavic letters adapted for [Albania](1534)n vowels. The book was discovered in 1740 by Gjon Nikollë Kazazi, the [Albania](1534)n archbishop of Skopje. It contains the liturgies of the main holidays. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and catechetical texts. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than those in the Gheg texts from the 17th century. The 188 pages of the book comprise about 154,000 words with a total vocabulary of c. 1,500 different words. The text is archaic yet easily interpreted because it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular portions of the Bible. The book also contains passages from the Psalms, the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah, the Letters to the Corinthians, and many illustrations. The uniformity of spelling seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing. The only known copy of the Meshari is held by the Apostolic Library. In 1968 the book was published with transliterations and comments by linguists.
The first printed work in Tosk [Albania](1534)n is the Mbsuame e krështerë (in Italian: Dottrina cristiana) by Lekë Matrënga or (in Italian) Luca Matranga. It was published in 1592 and is written in an early form of the [Arbëresh language](4239) (also known as Italo-[Albania](1534)n).
[Albania](1534)n scripts were produced earlier than the first attested document, formula e pagëzimit, but none yet have been discovered. We know of their existence by earlier references. For example, a French monk signed as "Broccardus" notes, in 1332, that "Although the [Albania](1534)ns have another language totally different from Latin, they still use Latin letters in all their books".

Disputed earlier texts
In 1967 two scholars claimed to have found a Letter text in [Albania](1534)n inserted into the Bellifortis text, a book written in Latin dating to 1402–1405.

"A star has fallen in a place in the woods, distinguish the star, distinguish it.
Distinguish the star from the others, they are ours, they are.
Do you see where the great voice has resounded? Stand beside it
That thunder. It did not fall. It did not fall for you, the one which would do it.
...
Like the ears, you should not believe ... that the moon fell when ...
Try to encompass that which spurts far ...

Call the light when the moon falls and no longer exists ..."
Robert Elsie, a specialist in [Albania](1534)n studies, considers that "The Todericiu/Polena Romanian translation of the non-Latin lines, although it may offer some clues if the text is indeed [Albania](1534)n, is fanciful and based, among other things, on a false reading of the manuscript, including the exclusion of a whole line."

Ottoman period
In 1635, Frang Bardhi (1606–1643) published in Rome his Dictionarum latinum-epiroticum, the first known Latin-[Albania](1534)n dictionary. Other scholars who studied the language during the 17th century include Andrea Bogdani (1600–1685), author of the first Latin-[Albania](1534)n grammar book, Nilo Katalanos (1637–1694) and others.

Indo-[Europe](1994)an features
Indo-[Europe](1994)an vocabulary
PIE phonological correspondences
Phonologically, [Albania](1534)n is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks, it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both PIE *d and *dʰ became [Albania](1534)n: d). In addition, voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. mik 'friend' from Lat. amicus). PIE *o appears as a (also as e if a high front vowel i follows), while PIE *ē and *ā become o, and PIE *ō appears as e.
The palatals, velars, and labiovelars show distinct developments, with [Albania](1534)n showing the three-way distinction also found in Luwian. Labiovelars are for the most part differentiated from all other Indo-[Europe](1994)an velar series before front vowels, but they merge with the "pure" (back) velars elsewhere. The palatal velar series, consisting of Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an *ḱ and the merged *ģ and *ģʰ, usually developed into *th and *dh, but were depalatalised to merge with the back velars when in contact with sonorants. Because the original Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an tripartite distinction between dorsals is preserved in such reflexes, [Albania](1534)n is therefore neither centum nor satem, despite having a "satem-like" realization of the palatal dorsals in most cases. Thus PIE *ḱ, *k, and *kʷ become th, q, and s, respectively (before back vowels PIE *ḱ becomes th, while *k and *kʷ merge as k).
A minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth laryngeal *h₄ allegedly surfacing as Alb. h word-initially, e.g. Alb. herdhe 'testicles' presumably from PIE *h₄órǵʰi- (rather than the usual reconstruction *h₃erǵʰi-), but this is generally not followed elsewhere, as h- has arisen elsewhere idiosyncratically (for example Alb. hark < Lat. arcus).

Standard [Albania](1534)n
Since World War II, standard [Albania](1534)n used in [Albania](1534) has been based on the Tosk dialect. Kosovo and other areas where [Albania](1534)n is official adopted the Tosk standard in 1969.

Elbasan-based standard
Until the early 20th century, [Albania](1534)n writing developed in three main literary traditions: Gheg, Tosk, and Arbëreshë. Throughout this time, a Gheg subdialect spoken around Elbasan served as lingua franca among the [Albania](1534)ns, but was less prevalent in writing. The Congress of Manastir of [Albania](1534)n writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classified as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.
Between 1916 and 1918, the [Albania](1534)n Literary Commission met in Shkodër under the leadership of Luigj Gurakuqi with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of [Albania](1534), reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.
When the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new [Albania](1534)n government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced it for creative writing. Gheg and Tosk continued to develop freely and interaction between the two dialects increased.

Tosk standard
At the end of World War II, however, the new communist regime radically imposed the use of the Tosk dialect in all facets of life in [Albania](1534): administration, education, and literature. Most Communist leaders were Tosks from the south. Standardisation was directed by the [Albania](1534)n Institute of Linguistics and Literature of the Academy of Sciences of [Albania](1534). Two dictionaries were published in 1954: an [Albania](1534)n language dictionary and a Russian–[Albania](1534)n dictionary. New orthography rules were eventually published in 1967 and in 1973 with the Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe (Orthography of the [Albania](1534)n Language).
Until 1968, Kosovo and other [Albania](1534)n-speaking areas in Yugoslavia followed the 1917 standard based on the Elbasan dialect, though it was gradually infused with Gheg elements in an effort to develop a Kosovan language separate from communist [Albania](1534)'s Tosk-based standard. [Albania](1534)n intellectuals in the former Yugoslavia consolidated the 1917 standard twice in the 1950s, culminating with a thorough codification of orthographic rules in 1964. The rules already provided for a balanced variety that accounted for both Gheg and Tosk dialects, but only lasted through 1968. Viewing divergences with [Albania](1534) as a threat to their identity, Kosovars arbitrarily adopted the Tosk project that Tirana had published the year before. Although it was never intended to serve outside of [Albania](1534), the project became the "unified literary language" in 1972, when approved by a rubberstamp Orthography Congress. Only about 1 in 9 participants were from Kosovo. The Congress, held at Tirana, authorized the orthography rules that came out the following year, in 1973.
More recent dictionaries from the [Albania](1534)n government are Fjalori Drejtshkrimor i Gjuhës Shqipe (1976) (Orthographic Dictionary of the [Albania](1534)n Language) and Dictionary of Today's [Albania](1534)n language (Fjalori i Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe) (1980). Prior to World War II, dictionaries consulted by developers of the standard have included Lexikon tis Alvanikis glossis ([Albania](1534)n: Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe (Kostandin Kristoforidhi, 1904), Fjalori i Bashkimit (1908), and Fjalori i Gazullit (1941).

Calls for reform
Since the fall of the communist regime, [Albania](1534)n orthography has stirred heated debate among scholars, writers, and public opinion in [Albania](1534) and Kosovo, with hardliners opposed to any changes in the orthography, moderates supporting varying degrees of reform, and radicals calling for a return to the Elbasan dialect. Criticism of Standard [Albania](1534)n has centred on the exclusion of the 'me + participle' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard [Albania](1534)n disenfranchises and stigmatises Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard view the 1972 Congress as a milestone achievement in [Albania](1534)n history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to "divide the nation" or "create two languages." Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified [Albania](1534)n language, but believe that the 'me + participle' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard [Albania](1534)n.
Many writers continue to write in the Elbasan dialect but other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature. Most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me + participle' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.
In 2013, a group of academics for [Albania](1534) and Kosovo proposed minor changes to the orthography. Hardline academics boycotted the initiative, while other reformers have viewed it as well-intentioned but flawed and superficial.

Education
[Albania](1534)n is the medium of instruction in most [Albania](1534)n schools. The literacy rate in [Albania](1534) for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1–9), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.

Phonology
Standard [Albania](1534)n has seven vowels and 29 consonants. Like English, [Albania](1534)n has dental fricatives /θ/ (like the th in thin) and /ð/ (like the th in this), written as ⟨th⟩ and ⟨dh⟩, which are rare cross-linguistically.
Gheg uses long and nasal vowels, which are absent in Tosk, and the mid-central vowel ë is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg n (femën: compare English feminine) changes to r by rhotacism in Tosk (femër).

Consonants
Notes:

The contrast between flapped r and trilled rr is the almost the same as in Spanish or Armenian. However, in most of the dialects, as also in standard [Albania](1534)n, the single r changes from an alveolar flap /ɾ/ to an alveolar approximant ɹ.
The palatal nasal /ɲ/ corresponds to the Spanish ñ and the French and Italian gn. It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.
The ll sound is a velarised lateral, close to English dark l.
The letter ç is sometimes written ch due to technical limitations, in analogy to the other digraphs xh, sh, and zh. Usually it is written simply c or more rarely q with context resolving any ambiguities.
The sounds spelled with q and gj show variation. They may range between occurring as palatal affricates c͡ç, ɟ͡ʝ or as palatal stops c, ɟ among dialects. Some speakers merge them into the palatoalveolar sounds ç and xh. This is especially common in Northern Gheg, but is increasingly the case in Tosk as well. Other speakers reduced them into /j/ in consonant clusters, such as in the word fjollë, which before standardisation was written as fqollë ( < Medieval Greek φακιολης).
The ng can be pronounced as /ŋ/ in final position, otherwise it is an allophone of n before k and g.
Before q and gj, n is always pronounced /ɲ/ but this is not reflected in the orthography.

Vowels
Notes
ë can also range to an open-mid sound ɜ in the Northern Tosk dialect.
Mid sounds /e, o/ can also be heard as more open-mid sounds ɛ, ɔ, in free variation.

Schwa
The schwa in [Albania](1534)n has a great degree of variability from extreme back to extreme front articulation. Although the Indo-[Europe](1994)an schwa (*ə or *-h₂-) was preserved in [Albania](1534)n, in some cases it was lost, possibly when a stressed syllable preceded it. Until the standardisation of the modern [Albania](1534)n alphabet, in which the schwa is spelled as ⟨ë⟩, as in the work of Gjon Buzuku in the 16th century, various vowel letters and digraphs were employed, including ⟨ae⟩ by Lekë Matrënga and ⟨é⟩ by Pjetër Bogdani in the late 16th and early 17th century. Within the borders of [Albania](1534), the phoneme is pronounced about the same in both the Tosk and the Gheg dialect due to the influence of standard [Albania](1534)n. However, in the Gheg dialects spoken in the neighbouring [Albania](1534)n-speaking areas of Kosovo and North Macedonia, the phoneme is still pronounced as back and rounded.

Grammar
[Albania](1534)n has a canonical word order of SVO (subject–verb–object) like English and many other Indo-[Europe](1994)an languages. [Albania](1534)n nouns are categorised by gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) and inflected for number (singular and plural) and case. There are five declensions and six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words (such as 'bir' ("son"), vocative case: biro, zog ("bird") vocative case: zogo), and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive construction employs the prepositions i/e/të/së alongside dative morphemes). Some dialects also retain a locative case, which is not present in standard [Albania](1534)n (e.g. "në malt" loc.sg.def). The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns, and there are numerous cases of syncretism.
The following shows the declension of mal (mountain), a noun in the masculine class which takes "i" in the definite singular:

The following shows the declension of the noun zog (bird), a noun in the masculine class which takes "u" in the definite singular:

The following table shows the declension of the noun vajzë (girl) in the feminine class:

The definite article is placed after the noun as in many other Balkan languages, like in Romanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian.

The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case.
For example, in singular nominative, masculine nouns add -i, or those ending in -g/-k/-h take -u (to avoid palatalization):
mal (mountain) / mali (the mountain);
libër (book) / libri (the book);
zog (bird) / zogu (the bird).
Nouns in the feminine class take the suffix -(i/j)a:
veturë (car) / vetura (the car);
shtëpi (house) / shtëpia (the house);
lule (flower) / lulja (the flower).
Nouns in the neuter class take -t.
[Albania](1534)n has developed an analytical verbal structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an. Its complex system of moods (six types) and tenses (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among Balkan languages. There are two general types of conjugations.
[Albania](1534)n has a series of verb forms called miratives or admiratives. These may express surprise on the part of the speaker, but may also have other functions, such as expressing irony, doubt, or reportedness. The [Albania](1534)n use of admirative forms is unique in the Balkan context. In English, the expression of surprise can be rendered by 'oh, look!' or 'lookee there!'; the expression of doubt can be rendered by 'indeed!'; the expression of neutral reportedness can be rendered by 'apparently'.

Ti flet shqip. "You speak [Albania](1534)n." (indicative)
Ti folke shqip! "You (surprisingly) speak [Albania](1534)n!" (admirative)
Rruga është e mbyllur. "The street is closed." (indicative)
Rruga qenka e mbyllur. "(Apparently,) The street is closed." (admirative)
For more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see [Albania](1534)n morphology.

Word order
[Albania](1534)n word order is relatively free. To say 'Agim ate all the oranges' in [Albania](1534)n, one may use any of the following orders, with slight pragmatic differences:

SVO: Agimi i hëngri të gjithë portokallët.
SOV: Agimi të gjithë portokallët i hëngri.
OVS: Të gjithë portokallët i hëngri Agimi.
OSV: Të gjithë portokallët Agimi i hëngri.
VSO: I hëngri Agimi të gjithë portokallët.
VOS: I hëngri të gjithë portokallët Agimi.
However, the most common order is subject–verb–object.
The verb can optionally occur in sentence-initial position, especially with verbs in the passive form (forma joveprore):

Parashikohet një ndërprerje "An interruption is anticipated".

Negation
Verbal negation in [Albania](1534)n is mood-dependent, a trait shared with some fellow Indo-[Europe](1994)an languages such as Greek.
In indicative, conditional, or admirative sentences, negation is expressed by the particles nuk or s' in front of the verb, for example:

Toni nuk flet anglisht "Tony does not speak English";
Toni s'flet anglisht "Tony doesn't speak English";
Nuk e di "I do not know";
S'e di "I don't know".
Subjunctive, imperative, optative, or non-finite forms of verbs are negated with the particle mos:

Mos harro "Do not forget!".

Numerals
Notes
In certain dialects, numerals with an extra syllable may undergo metrical syncope. For example, pesëmbëdhjetë becomes pesëmet.

Vigesimal system
Beside the Indo-[Europe](1994)an decimal numeration, there are also remnants of the vigesimal system, as njëzet 'twenty' and dyzet 'forty'. The Arbëreshë in Italy and Arvanites in Greece may still use trezet 'sixty' and katërzet 'eighty'. [Albania](1534)n is the only Balkan language that has preserved the Pre-Indo-[Europe](1994)an vigesimal system.

Lexicon
[Albania](1534)n is known within historical linguistics as a case of a language which, although surviving through many periods of foreign rule and multilingualism, saw a "disproportionately high" influx of loans from other languages augmenting and replacing much of its original vocabulary. Of all the foreign influences in [Albania](1534)n, the deepest reaching and most impactful was the absorption of loans from Latin in the Classical period and its Romance successors afterward. Scholars have estimated a great number of Latin loanwords in [Albania](1534)n, some even claiming 60% of the [Albania](1534)n vocabulary.
Major work in reconstructing Proto-[Albania](1534)n has been done with the help of knowledge of the original forms of loans from [Ancient Greek](3061), Latin and Slavic, while [Ancient Greek](3061) loanwords are scarce the Latin loanwords are of extreme importance in phonology. The presence of loanwords from more well-studied languages from time periods before [Albania](1534)n was attested, reaching deep back into the Classical Era, has been of great use in phonological reconstructions for earlier ancient and medieval forms of [Albania](1534)n. Some words in the core vocabulary of [Albania](1534)n have no known etymology linking them to Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an or any known source language, and as of 2018 are thus tentatively attributed to an unknown, unattested, pre-Indo-[Europe](1994)an substrate language; some words among these include zemër (heart) and hekur (iron). Some among these putative pre-IE words are thought to be related to putative pre-IE substrate words in neighboring Indo-[Europe](1994)an languages, such as lule (flower), which has been tentatively linked to Latin lilia and Greek leirion.
Lexical distance of [Albania](1534)n to other languages in a lexicostatistical analysis by Ukrainian linguist Tyshchenko shows the following results (the lower figure, the higher similarity): 49% Slovenian, 53% Romanian, 56% Greek, 82% French, 86% Macedonian, 86% Bulgarian.

Cognates with Illyrian
Early linguistic influences
The earliest loanwords attested in [Albania](1534)n come from Doric Greek, whereas the strongest influence came from Latin. Some scholars argue that [Albania](1534)n originated from an area located east of its present geographic spread due to the several common lexical items found between the [Albania](1534)n and Romanian languages. However it does not necessarily define the genealogical history of [Albania](1534)n language, and it does not exclude the possibility of Proto-[Albania](1534)n presence in both Illyrian and Thracian territory.
The period during which Proto-[Albania](1534)n and Latin interacted was protracted, lasting from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Over this period, the lexical borrowings can be roughly divided into three layers, the second of which is the largest. The first and smallest occurred at the time of less significant interaction. The final period, probably preceding the Slavic or Germanic invasions, also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterised by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-[Albania](1534)n into [Albania](1534)n; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably Proto-Romance). Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalisation.
A brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from South Slavic, some of which predate the "o-a" shift common to the modern forms of this language group.

Early Greek loans
There are some 30 [Ancient Greek](3061) loanwords in Proto-[Albania](1534)n. Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect. Other loanwords are Doric; these words mainly refer to commodity items and trade goods and probably came through trade with a now-extinct intermediary.

drapër; "sickle" < (Northwest Greek) drápanon
bletë; "hive, bee" < Attic mélitta "bee" (vs. Ionic mélissa).
kumbull; "plum" < kokkúmelon
lakër; "cabbage, green vegetables" < lákhanon "green; vegetable"
lëpjetë; "orach, dock" < lápathon
lyej; "to smear, to oil"< Proto-[Albania](1534)n *elaiwanja < *elaiwa (olive oil) < Greek elaion 
mokër; "millstone" < (Northwest) mākhaná "device, instrument"
mollë; "apple" < mēlon "fruit"
pëllëmbë; "palm of the hand" < palámā
pjepër; "melon" < pépōn
presh; "leek" < práson
trumzë; "thyme" < (Northwest) thýmbrā, thrýmbrē
pellg; "pond, pool" < pélagos "high sea"
According to Huld (1986), the following come from a Greek dialect without any significant attestation called "Makedonian" because it was akin to the native idiom of the Greek-speaking population in the Argead kingdom:

llërë; "elbow" < *ὠlénā
brukë; "tamarisk" < *mīrýkhā
mëllagë; 'mallow' < *malákhā (with the reflex of /ɡ/ for Greek <χ> indicating a dialectal voicing of the what came as an aspirate stop from Greek)
maraj "fennel" < *márathrion (cf Romanian mărar(iu), Ionic márathron; with the [Albania](1534)n simplification of -dri̯- to -j- reflecting that of earlier *udri̯om to ujë "water")

Latin influence
Scholars have estimated a great number of Latin loanwords in [Albania](1534)n, some even claiming 60% of the [Albania](1534)n vocabulary. They include many frequently used core vocabulary items, including shumë ("very", from Latin summus), pak ("few", Latin paucus), ngushtë ("narrow", Latin angustus), pemë ("tree", Latin poma), vij ("to come", Latin veniō), rërë ("sand", Latin arena), drejt ("straight", Latin directus), kafshë ("beast", Latin causa, meaning "thing"), and larg ("far away", Latin largus).
Jernej Kopitar (1780–1844) was the first to note Latin's influence on [Albania](1534)n and claimed "the Latin loanwords in the [Albania](1534)n language had the pronunciation of the time of Emperor Augustus". Kopitar gave examples such as [Albania](1534)n qiqer 'chickpea' from Latin cicer, qytet 'city, town' from civitas, peshk 'fish' from piscis, and shigjetë 'arrow' from sagitta. The hard pronunciations of Latin ⟨c⟩ and ⟨g⟩ are retained as palatal and velar stops in the [Albania](1534)n loanwords. Gustav Meyer (1888) and Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke (1914) later corroborated this. Meyer noted the similarity between the [Albania](1534)n verbs shqipoj "to speak clearly, enunciate" and shqiptoj "to pronounce, articulate" and the Latin word excipiō (meaning "to welcome"). Therefore, he believed that the word Shqiptar "[Albania](1534)n person" was derived from shqipoj, which in turn was derived from the Latin word excipere. Johann Georg von Hahn, an [Austria](1585)n linguist, had proposed the same hypothesis in 1854.
Eqrem Çabej also noticed, among other things, the archaic Latin elements in [Albania](1534)n:

Latin /au/ becomes [Albania](1534)n /a/ in the earliest loanwords: aurum → ar 'gold'; gaudium → gaz 'joy'; laurus → lar 'laurel'. Latin /au/ is retained in later loans, but is altered in a way similar to Greek: causa 'thing' → kafshë 'thing; beast, brute'; laud → lavd.
Latin /oː/ becomes [Albania](1534)n /e/ in the oldest Latin loans: pōmus → pemë 'fruit tree'; hōra → herë 'time, instance'. An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an to [Albania](1534)n; PIE *nōs became [Albania](1534)n ne 'we', PIE *oḱtṓw + suffix -ti- became [Albania](1534)n tetë 'eight', etc.
Latin unstressed internal and initial syllables become lost in [Albania](1534)n: cubitus → kub 'elbow'; medicus → mjek 'physician'; palūdem 'swamp' → Vulgar Latin *padūle → pyll 'forest'. An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an to [Albania](1534)n. In contrast, in later Latin loanwords, the internal syllable is retained: paganus → pagan; plaga → plagë 'wound', etc.
Latin /tj/, /dj/, /kj/ palatalized to [Albania](1534)n /s/, /z/, /c/: vitium → ves 'vice; worries'; ratiōnem → arsye 'reason'; radius → rreze 'ray; spoke'; faciēs → faqe 'face, cheek'; socius → shok 'mate, comrade', shoq 'husband', etc. In turn, Latin /s/ was altered to /ʃ/ in [Albania](1534)n.
Haralambie Mihăescu demonstrated that:

Some 85 Latin words have survived in [Albania](1534)n but not (as inherited) in any Romance language. A few examples include Late Latin celsydri → dial. kulshedër → kuçedër 'hydra', hībernus → vërri 'winter pasture', sarcinārius 'used for packing, loading' → shelqëror 'forked peg, grapnel, forked hanger', sōlānum 'nightshade', lit. 'sun plant' → shullë(r) 'sunny place out of the wind, sunbathed area', splēnēticus → shpretkë 'spleen', trifurcus → tërfurk 'pitchfork'.
151 [Albania](1534)n words of Latin origin were not inherited in Romanian. A few examples include Latin amīcus → [Albania](1534)n mik 'friend', inimīcus → armik 'foe, enemy', ratiōnem → arsye, benedīcere → bekoj, bubulcus 'ploughman, herdsman' → bulk, bujk 'peasant', calicis → qelq 'drinking glass', castellum → kështjellë 'castle', centum → qind 'hundred', gallus → gjel 'rooster', iunctūra → gjymtyrë 'limb; joint', medicus → mjek 'doctor', retem → rrjetë 'net', spērāre → dial. shp(ë)rej, shpresoj 'to hope', pres 'to await', voluntās (voluntātis) → vullnet 'will; volunteer'.
Some [Albania](1534)n church terminology has phonetic features which demonstrate their very early borrowing from Latin. A few examples include [Albania](1534)n bekoj 'to bless' from benedīcere, engjëll 'angel' from angelus, kishë 'church' from ecclēsia, i krishterë 'Christian' from christiānus, kryq 'cross' from crux (crucis), (obsolete) lter 'altar' from Latin altārium, mallkoj 'to curse' from maledīcere, meshë 'mass' from missa, murg 'monk' from monachus, peshkëp 'bishop' from episcopus, and ungjill 'gospel' from ēvangelium.
Other authors have detected Latin loanwords in [Albania](1534)n with an ancient sound pattern from the 1st century BC, for example, [Albania](1534)n qingël(ë) 'saddle girth; dwarf elder' from Latin cingula and [Albania](1534)n e vjetër 'old, aged; former' from vjet but influenced by Latin veteris. The Romance languages inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: cingula became (via *clinga) Romanian chingă 'girdle; saddle girth', and veterānus became Romanian bătrân 'old'.
[Albania](1534)n, Basque, and the surviving Celtic languages such as Breton and Welsh are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages. Other languages in or near the former Roman area either came on the scene later (Turkish, the Slavic languages, Arabic) or borrowed little from Latin despite coexisting with it (Greek, German), although German does have a few such ancient Latin loanwords (Fenster 'window', Käse 'cheese').
Romanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the [Albania](1534)n language, have concluded that [Albania](1534)n was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and Dalmatian. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and [Albania](1534)n are significantly fewer in number than those that are common to only [Albania](1534)n and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the [Albania](1534)n language evolved in a region with much greater contact with Western Romance regions than with Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day [Albania](1534), Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.

Slavic influence
After the Slavs arrived in the Balkans, the Slavic languages became an additional source of loanwords. Contact between [Albania](1534)n with the Slavic languages lasted very intensively for almost four centuries, and continued even in the late Middle Ages. Slavic loanwords in [Albania](1534)n constitute a less studied area in literature. Per Vladimir Orel (1998), there are about 556 Slavic loanwords in [Albania](1534)n.

Turkish influence
The rise of the Ottoman Empire meant an influx of Turkish words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some Turkish personal names, such as Altin, are common. There are some loanwords from Modern Greek, especially in the south of [Albania](1534). Many borrowed words have been replaced by words with [Albania](1534)n roots or modern Latinised (international) words. According to calculations mentioned by Emanuele Banfi (1985), the total number of Turkish loanwords in [Albania](1534)n is about two thousand. However, when taking into account obsolete and rare words, and restricted dialectalisms, their number is considerably larger.

Gothic
[Albania](1534)n is also known to possess a small set of loans from Gothic, with early inquiry into the matter done by Norbert Jokl and Sigmund Feist, though such loans had been claimed earlier in the 19th century by early linguists such as Gustav Meyer. Many words claimed as Gothic have now been attributed to other origins by later linguists of [Albania](1534)n (fat and tufë, though used for major claims by Huld in 1994, are now attributed to Latin, for example), or may instead be native to [Albania](1534)n, inherited from Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an. Today, it is accepted that there are a few words from Gothic in [Albania](1534)n, but for the most part they are scanty because the Goths had few contacts with Balkan peoples.
Martin Huld defends the significance of the admittedly sparse Gothic loans for [Albania](1534)n studies, however, arguing that Gothic is the only clearly post-Roman and "pre-Ottoman" language after Latin with a notable influence on the [Albania](1534)n lexicon (the influence of Slavic languages is both pre-Ottoman and Ottoman). He argues that Gothic words in [Albania](1534)n are attributable to the late fourth and early fifth centuries during the invasions of various Gothic speaking groups of the Balkans under Alaric, Odoacer, and Theodoric. He argues that [Albania](1534)n Gothicisms bear evidence for the ordering of developments within Proto-[Albania](1534)n at this time: for example, he argues Proto-[Albania](1534)n at this stage had already shifted /uː/ to /y/ as Gothic words with /uː/ reflect with /u/ in [Albania](1534)n, not /y/ as seen in most Latin and ancient Greek loans, but had not yet experienced the shift of /t͡s/ to /θ/, since loans from Gothic words with /θ/ replace /θ/ with /t/ or another close sound.
Notable words that continue to be attributed to Gothic in [Albania](1534)n by multiple modern sources include:

tirk "felt gaiters, white felt" (cf Romanian tureac "top of boot") < Gothic *θiuh-brōks- or *θiuhbrōkeis, cf Old High German theobrach "gaiters"
shkumë "foam" < Gothic *skūm-, perhaps via an intermediary in a Romance *scuma (cf. Romanian spumă)
gardh "fence, garden" is either considered a native [Albania](1534)n word that was loaned into Romanian as gard
zverk "nape, back of neck" < Gothic *swairhs; the "difficult" word having various otherwise been attributed (with phonological issues) to Celtic, Greek or native development.
horr "villain, scoundrel" and horre "whore" < Gothic *hors "adulterer, cf Old Norse hóra "whore"
punjashë "purse", diminutive of punjë < Gothic puggs "purse" (cf. Romanian pungă)

Patterns in loaning
Although [Albania](1534)n is characterised by the absorption of many loans, even, in the case of Latin, reaching deep into the core vocabulary, certain semantic fields nevertheless remained more resistant. Terms pertaining to social organisation are often preserved, though not those pertaining to political organisation, while those pertaining to trade are all loaned or innovated.
Hydronyms present a complicated picture; the term for "sea" (det) is native and an "Albano-Germanic" innovation referring to the concept of depth, but a large amount of maritime vocabulary is loaned. Words referring to large streams and their banks tend to be loans, but lumë ("river") is native, as is rrymë (the flow of water). Words for smaller streams and stagnant pools of water are more often native, but the word for "pond", pellg is in fact a semantically shifted descendant of the old Greek word for "high sea", suggesting a change in location after Greek contact. [Albania](1534)n has maintained since Proto-Indo-[Europe](1994)an a specific term referring to a riverside forest (gjazë), as well as its words for marshes. [Albania](1534)n has maintained native terms for "whirlpool", "water pit" and (aquatic) "deep place", leading Orel to speculate that the [Albania](1534)n Urheimat likely had an excess of dangerous whirlpools and depths.
Regarding forests, words for most conifers and shrubs are native, as are the terms for "alder", "elm", "oak", "beech", and "linden", while "ash", "chestnut", "birch", "maple", "poplar", and "willow" are loans.
The original kinship terminology of Indo-[Europe](1994)an was radically reshaped; changes included a shift from "mother" to "sister", and were so thorough that only three terms retained their original function, the words for "son-in-law", "mother-in-law" and "father-in-law". All the words for second-degree blood kinship, including "aunt", "uncle", "nephew", "niece", and terms for grandchildren, are ancient loans from Latin.
The Proto-[Albania](1534)ns appear to have been cattle breeders given the vastness of preserved native vocabulary pertaining to cow breeding, milking and so forth, while words pertaining to dogs tend to be loaned. Many words concerning horses are preserved, but the word for horse itself is a Latin loan.
