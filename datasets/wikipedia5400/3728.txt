Ahmose-Henuttamehu
Ahmose-Henuttamehu ("Child of the Moon; Mistress of Lower [Egypt](1987)") was a princess and queen of the late 17th-early 18th dynasties of [Egypt](1987).

Family
Ahmose-Henuttamehu was a daughter of Pharaoh Seqenenre Tao by his sister-wife [Ahmose I](3733)nhapy. She was probably married to her half-brother Pharaoh [Ahmose I](3733), since her titles include King's Wife (hmt-nisw), Great King's Wife (hmt-niswt-wrt), King's Daughter (s3t-niswt) and King's Sister (snt-niswt). Ahmose-Henuttamehu was a half-sister to the Great Royal Wife and God's Wife of Amun [Ahmose-Nefertari](3730).

Life and burial
Not much is known about the life of Ahmose-Henuttamehu. The Queen is mentioned on a stela as depicted in Lepsius' Denkm√§ler.
Ahmose-Henuttamehu's mummy was discovered in 1881 in her own coffin in the tomb DB320 and is now in the [Egypt](1987)ian Museum in Cairo. It was examined by Gaston Maspero in December 1882. Henuttamehu was an old woman when she died, with worn teeth. Quotes from the Book of the Dead were written on her mummy bandages. She was probably buried together with her mother; her mummy was taken to DB320 along with other mummies after Year 11 of Pharaoh Shoshenq I.
Ahmose-Henuttamehu is included in the list of royal ancestors worshipped in the Nineteenth Dynasty. She appears in the tomb of Khabekhnet in Thebes.
