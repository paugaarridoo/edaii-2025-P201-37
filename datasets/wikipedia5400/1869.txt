Two of the suburb's main landmarks are [Athlone Stadium](1871) and the decommissioned coal-burning [Athlone Power Station](1870).

Originally known as West London the area was renamed Athlone after Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone who was Governor-General of the Union of South Africa from 1924 to 1930.
During [Apartheid](1858) the area was designated a coloured neighborhood. Many people were resettled in the area after being forcibly evicted by the government under the [Apartheid](1858) era Group Areas Act from other parts of [Cape Town](1800).
Athlone is the home of the Trojan Horse Memorial, a reminder of the Trojan Horse Incident which took place in 1985, when three anti-apartheid protesters were killed and fifteen others wounded in a police ambush.
