Uniforms and logos
The Barrie Colts logo displays an angry horse holding a hockeystick, surrounded by a horseshoe. The Colts colours are red, white, navy blue & gold. The home uniforms are a white background, with red, navy blue and gold trim. The away uniforms are a navy blue background, with red, white & gold trim. Barrie also briefly used a third jersey which was a red background, with white, navy blue & gold trim.
For the 2007–08 season, the Colts have worn a new third jersey. It has a navy blue blackground with white, red and gold trim along the bottom, with the word "Colts" diagonally across the front. For the 2009–10 season the colts wore the Rbk Edge uniforms with a new template.

Arenas
The Barrie Colts played at the Barrie Arena during their tenure in the Junior B days and Junior A Tier II days, and also for a portion of their inaugural OHL season until their new arena was completed. The Barrie Arena was located in downtown Barrie and was formerly home to the Barrie Flyers OHA team from 1945 to 1960 and other senior hockey teams. The Arena was torn down in 2008.
Barrie Molson Centre was completed during the early portion of the 1995–96 season. The layout of the arena served as a blueprint for many new OHL arenas built shortly thereafter. The Horsepower Grill restaurant is located at the west end of the arena. The Barrie Molson Centre is located near the southern entrance of Park Place, close to Highway 400.  The arena has since been renamed "The Barrie Colts Centre" and then, pursuant to a 10-year naming rights agreement with Paul Sadlon Motors Inc. for $170,121 per year (for a total of $1,701,210), beginning in the Colts' 2021-22 season, the "Sadlon Arena".
