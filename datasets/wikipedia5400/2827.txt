List of strawberry cultivars
The following is a partial list of strawberry cultivars. Strawberries come in a wide assortment of commercially available cultivars (cultivated varieties). Differences between cultivars may include the date the fruit ripens, disease resistance, freezing quality, firmness, berry size, berry shape, and flavor. Many different cultivars have been developed at the University of California (Davis campus), by Driscoll [Strawberry](2800) Associates Inc. (Watsonville, California), the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and East Malling Research Station in the UK.
Almost all the strawberries listed below are cultivars of [Fragaria](2850) × ananassa. Two cultivars listed here ('Frel' (Pink Panda) and 'Samba' (Red Ruby)) are bigeneric hybrids, grown mainly for their flower colour rather than their fruit, using a closely related species (Potentilla palustris = Comarum palustre) to introduce pink or red colouration to the flowers.
The cultivar [Fragaria](2850) × ananassa 'Variegata' is grown mainly for the decorative qualities of its variegated foliage.
