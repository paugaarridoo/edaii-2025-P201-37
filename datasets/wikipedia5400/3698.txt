Civil Order of Alfonso XII
The Civil Order of Alfonso XII (Spanish: Orden Civil de Alfonso XII) is a Spanish honorific decoration named for King Alfonso XII (1857â€“1885). It was established by Royal Decree on 23 May 1902 to reward achievements in education, science, culture, teaching and research.

History
According to Article 3 of the Royal Decree, the order is composed of three categories: Grand Cross (Spanish: Gran Cruz), Commander (Spanish: Encomienda), and Chevalier (Spanish: Caballero).
Beginning in 1939, the members of the Order could request their entry into the newly created Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise.
Royal Decree 954/1988, of 2 September, finalized its replacement with the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise, "adapting its norms to the social conditions of the present time and to the democratic principles on which the legal system is based."
