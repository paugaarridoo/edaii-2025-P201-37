List of C-family programming languages
The C-family programming languages share significant features of the C programming language. Many were developmentally influenced by C due to its success and ubiquity. The family also includes predecessors that influenced C's design such as [BCPL](828).
Notable programming sources use terms like C-style, C-like, a dialect of C, having C-like syntax. The term curly bracket programming language denotes a language that shares C's block syntax.
C-family languages have features like:

Code block delimited by curly braces ({}), a.k.a. braces, a.k.a. curly brackets
Semicolon (;) statement terminator
Parameter list delimited by parentheses (())
Infix notation for arithmetical and logical expressions
C-family languages span multiple programming paradigms, conceptual models, and run-time environments.
