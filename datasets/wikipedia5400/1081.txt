2028 Summer Paralympics
The 2028 Summer Paralympics, also known as the 18th Summer Paralympic Games, and branded as Los Angeles 2028 or LA28, is an upcoming international multi-sport parasports event governed by the International Paralympic Committee, scheduled to take place from August 15 to August 27, 2028, in Los Angeles, California, United States.
Marking Los Angeles' first time as the host of the Paralympics, the Games will be the first Summer Paralympics in the United States since the 1996 edition in Atlanta, Georgia, and the third overall.
The Games will see the debut of Paraclimbing as an event.

Bids
As part of a formal agreement between the International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee first established in 2001, the winner of the bid for the Summer Olympics also holds the Summer Paralympics.
Due to concerns over a number of cities withdrawing in the bid process of the 2022 Winter Olympics and [2024 Summer Olympics](1077), a process to award the 2024 and 2028 Games simultaneously to the final two cities in the running to the [2024 Summer Olympics](1077)—Los Angeles and Paris—was approved at an Extraordinary IOC Session on July 11, 2017, in Lausanne. Paris was understood to be the preferred host for the 2024 Games. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 Games, leaving Paris to be confirmed as hosts for the 2024 Games. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on September 13, 2017.

The Games
A record 33 sports applied for inclusion in the Games, including the 22 sports contested in 2024, bids to reinstate CP football (football 7-a-side) and sailing, and bids for arm wrestling, beach paravolley, paraclimbing, para dance sport, golf, karate, powerchair football, surfing, and wheelchair handball as new sports. 
The initial program of 22 sports was ratified at a meeting of the IPC's governing board in January 2023, with no changes from the program of the [2024 Summer Paralympics](1078). The IPC shortlisted paraclimbing and para surfing for consideration as new sports by the LA28 organizing committee. In June 2024, LA28 announced that it had proposed to the IPC the inclusion of paraclimbing, which would be ratified on June 26.
After the closing of procedures, in September 2024, Ravi Chauhan, the Secretary of Differently Abled Cricket Council of India, said that he requested for the inclusion of para-cricket in LA28 Paralympics, following his meeting with IPC President Andrew Parsons, who has "shown confidence". However, it is not yet known whether there is any type of negotiation between the parties involved. This was during a two-month tour by India national blind cricket team to promote blind cricket in USA.
