2019 Western Cape provincial election
The 2019 Western Cape provincial election was held on 8 May 2019 to elect the 6th Western Cape Provincial Parliament. It was the sixth provincial election held since the establishment of the provincial legislature in 1994.
Incumbent premier Helen Zille of the Democratic Alliance (DA) was term-limited and could not seek a third term. The party nominated [Alan Winde](1839) to succeed her.
The provincial election was won by the ruling Democratic Alliance (DA), but with a reduced majority of 55.45%, down from 59.38% in the 2014 election. The party lost two seats and achieved a majority of 24 seats in the legislature.  The Official Opposition [African National Congress](1831) (ANC) declined from 32.89% to 28.64%, and also lost two seats. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) significantly grew, going from 2.11% to 4.04%, and, consequently, gained one seat. The newly-formed Good received 3.11% of the vote and won a seat. The [African Christian Democratic Party](1830) (ACDP) grew to 2.66% and retained its sole seat. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and [Al Jama-ah](1837) also won one seat each.

Background
The 2014 provincial election resulted in the continuation of the incumbent Democratic Alliance provincial government headed by Helen Zille. This would be Zille's second and final term as Premier of the Western Cape. The party increased its seat total from 22 to 26 seats. The [African National Congress](1831) with Marius Fransman remained the Official Opposition with 14 seats. The newly-formed Economic Freedom Fighters became the third largest party with only one seat. The [African Christian Democratic Party](1830) retained its sole seat.
On 18 April 2015, incumbent Democratic Alliance Provincial Leader Ivan Meyer announced that he would not seek re-election. Mayor of Cape Town Patricia de Lille was elected as his successor.
In January 2016, allegations of sexual harassment were made against [African National Congress](1831) Provincial Chairperson Marius Fransman by his former assistant, Louisa Wynand. The party named Khaya Magaxa as his acting successor. Fransman was suspended as Provincial Chairperson in February 2016, and expelled from the [African National Congress](1831) in November 2016.
In February 2017, Patricia de Lille resigned as Provincial Leader of the Democratic Alliance in order to focus on her mayorship.  Deputy Provincial Leader Bonginkosi Madikizela was designated as the interim leader of the party. Madikizela was later elected to a full term in October 2017.
Throughout 2017 and 2018, the Democratic Alliance accused Patricia de Lille of maladministration and covering up corruption in the City of Cape Town. She strongly denied these allegations.
In April 2018, former Western Cape Premier Ebrahim Rasool was announced as the head of the ANCâ€™s Western Cape elections campaign.
In August 2018, Patricia de Lille announced that she would resign as Mayor of Cape Town, effective on 31 October 2018.
In September 2018, The Democratic Alliance selected [Alan Winde](1839) as the party's Western Cape Premier candidate.
In October 2018, Patricia de Lille resigned as both Mayor of Cape Town and member of the Democratic Alliance. She was succeeded by her predecessor, Dan Plato. She subsequently founded a new political party named Good in December 2018. The party contested the 2019 elections both nationally and provincially.
On 6 November 2018, former Provincial Minister of Community Safety Dan Plato was elected Mayor of Cape Town on 6 November 2018 during a special council sitting, receiving 146 out of 202 valid votes. Six ballots were spoilt. The vote was held via secret ballot. His main challengers were Xolani Sotashe from the [African National Congress](1831) and Grant Haskin from the [African Christian Democratic Party](1830). Sotashe received 53 votes while Haskin got 3 votes.
On 22 January 2019, the Freedom Front Plus announced that it had selected former premier of the Western Cape and mayor of Cape Town, Peter Marais, as its party premier candidate.
