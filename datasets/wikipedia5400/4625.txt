Algonquian–Basque pidgin
Algonquian–Basque pidgin, also known as Souriquois, is a Basque-based pidgin proposed by linguist Peter Bakker to have been spoken by Basque whalers and various [Algonquian peoples](1154). It was spoken around the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was in use from at least 1580 until 1635, and was last attested in 1711.
There were three groups of First Nations that the Basque people distinguished. The ones with which they had good relations were the Montagnais and the St. Lawrence Iroquoians. They also knew of the Inuit, whom they considered hostile. The Basque people referred to them as the Montaneses, the Canaleses, and the Esquimoas, respectively.
