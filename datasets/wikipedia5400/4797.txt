4797
Croatia
[Croatia](4797) ( , kroh-AY-shə; [Croatia](4797)n: Hrvatska, pronounced xř̩ʋaːtskaː), officially the Republic of [Croatia](4797) ([Croatia](4797)n: Republika Hrvatska ), is a country in Central and Southeast [Europe](1994), on the coast of the [Adriatic Sea](3719). It borders Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a maritime border with Italy to the west. Its capital and largest city, Zagreb, forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, with twenty counties. Other major urban centers include Split, Rijeka and Osijek. The country spans 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), and has a population of nearly 3.9 million.
The Croats arrived in modern-day [Croatia](4797) in the late 6th century, then part of Roman Illyria. By the 7th century, they had organized the territory into two duchies. [Croatia](4797) was first internationally recognized as independent on 7 June 879 during the reign of Duke Branimir. Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating [Croatia](4797) to the status of a kingdom. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirović dynasty ended, [Croatia](4797) entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the [Croatia](4797)n Parliament elected Ferdinand I of [Austria](1585) to the [Croatia](4797)n throne. In October 1918, the State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, independent from the Habsburg Empire, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918, it merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, most of [Croatia](4797) was incorporated into a Nazi-installed puppet state, the Independent State of [Croatia](4797). A resistance movement led to the creation of the Socialist Republic of [Croatia](4797), which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 25 June 1991, [Croatia](4797) declared independence, and the War of Independence was successfully fought over the next four years.
[Croatia](4797) is a republic and has a parliamentary system. It is a member of the [Europe](1994)an Union, the Eurozone, the Schengen Area, NATO, the United Nations, the [Council of [Europe](1994)](4789), the OSCE, the World Trade Organization, a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean, and is currently in the process of joining the OECD. An active participant in United Nations peacekeeping, [Croatia](4797) contributed troops to the International Security Assistance Force and was elected to fill a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council in the 2008–2009 term for the first time.
[Croatia](4797) is a developed country with an advanced high-income economy and ranks highly in the Human Development Index. Service, industrial sectors, and agriculture dominate the economy. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for the country, with nearly 20 million tourist arrivals as of 2019. Since the 2000s, the [Croatia](4797)n government has heavily invested in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-[Europe](1994)an corridors. [Croatia](4797) has also positioned itself as a regional energy leader in the early 2020s and is contributing to the diversification of [Europe](1994)'s energy supply via its floating liquefied natural gas import terminal off Krk island, LNG Hrvatska. [Croatia](4797) provides social security, universal health care, and tuition-free primary and secondary education while supporting culture through public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing.

Etymology
[Croatia](4797)'s non-native name derives from Medieval Latin Croātia, itself a derivation of North-West Slavic *Xərwate, by liquid metathesis from Common Slavic period *Xorvat, from proposed Proto-Slavic *Xъrvátъ which possibly comes from the 3rd-century Scytho-Sarmatian form attested in the Tanais Tablets as Χοροάθος (Khoroáthos, alternate forms comprise Khoróatos and Khoroúathos). The origin of the ethnonym is uncertain, but most probably is from Proto-Ossetian / Alanian *xurvæt- or *xurvāt-, in the meaning of "one who guards" ("guardian, protector").
The oldest preserved record of the [Croatia](4797)n ethnonym's native variation *xъrvatъ is of the variable stem, attested in the Baška tablet in style zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ ("Zvonimir, [Croatia](4797)n king"), while the Latin variation Croatorum is archaeologically confirmed on a church inscription found in Bijaći near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century. The presumably oldest stone inscription with fully preserved ethnonym is the 9th-century Branimir inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled Dux Cruatorvm, likely dated between 879 and 892, during his rule. The Latin term Chroatorum is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir I of [Croatia](4797), dated to 852 in a 1568 copy of a lost original, but it is not certain if the original was indeed older than the Branimir inscription.

History
Prehistory and antiquity
The area known as [Croatia](4797) today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period. Neanderthal fossils dating to the middle Palaeolithic period were unearthed in northern [Croatia](4797), best presented at the Krapina site. Remnants of Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions. The largest proportion of sites is in the valleys of northern [Croatia](4797). The most significant are Baden, Starčevo, and Vučedol cultures. Iron Age hosted the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.
The region of modern-day [Croatia](4797) was settled by Illyrians and Liburnians, while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of Hvar, Korčula, and Vis. In 9 AD, the territory of today's [Croatia](4797) became part of the Roman Empire. Emperor Diocletian was native to the region. He had a large palace built in Split, to which he retired after abdicating in AD 305.
During the 5th century, the last de jure Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475.

Middle Ages
The Roman period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.

The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain. The most accepted theory, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from White [Croatia](4797) during the Migration Period. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing [Ancient Greek](3061) inscriptions of given names Χορούαθος, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of [Croatia](4797)n people.
According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, Croats arrived in the Roman province of Dalmatia in the first half of the 7th century after they defeated the Avars. However, that claim is disputed: competing hypotheses date the event between the late 6th-early 7th (mainstream) or the late 8th-early 9th (fringe) centuries, but recent archaeological data has established that the migration and settlement of the Slavs/Croats was in the late 6th and early 7th century. Eventually, a dukedom was formed, Duchy of [Croatia](4797), ruled by Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of [Croatia](4797)n realms, vassal states of Francia at the time. Its neighbor to the North was Principality of Lower Pannonia, at the time ruled by duke Ljudevit who ruled the territories between the Drava and Sava rivers, centred from his fort at Sisak. This population and territory throughout history was tightly related and connected to Croats and [Croatia](4797).

Christianisation of Croats began in the 7th century at the time of archon Porga of [Croatia](4797), initially probably encompassed only the elite and related people, but mostly finished by the 9th century. The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav, or his successor Trpimir I. The native [Croatia](4797)n royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and [Bulgaria](4363)n forces. The first native [Croatia](4797)n ruler recognised by the Pope was duke Branimir, who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. Tomislav was the first king of [Croatia](4797), noted as such in a letter of Pope John X in 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and [Bulgaria](4363)n invasions. The medieval [Croatia](4797)n kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV (1058–1074) and Dmitar Zvonimir (1075–1089). When Stjepan II died in 1091, ending the Trpimirović dynasty, Dmitar Zvonimir's brother-in-law Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the [Croatia](4797)n crown. This led to a war and personal union with Hungary in 1102 under Coloman.

Union with Hungary and [Austria](1585)
For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of [Croatia](4797) was ruled by the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban (viceroy) appointed by the king. This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Šubić families to prominence, and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families. An increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and a struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas ensued. The Venetians controlled most of Dalmatia by 1428, except the city-state of Dubrovnik, which became independent. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and the 1526 Battle of Mohács, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Mohács, and in 1527, the [Croatia](4797)n Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as the new ruler of [Croatia](4797), under the condition that he protects [Croatia](4797) against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.
Following the decisive Ottoman victories, [Croatia](4797) was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the [Croatia](4797)n Military Frontier and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in [Croatia](4797) continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak, the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised. During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained, but western Bosnia, which had been part of [Croatia](4797) before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside [Croatia](4797)n control. The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.

The Ottoman wars drove demographic changes. During the 16th century, Croats from western and northern Bosnia, Lika, Krbava, the area between the rivers Una and Kupa, and especially from western Slavonia, migrated towards [Austria](1585). Present-day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers. To replace the fleeing population, the Habsburgs encouraged Bosnians to provide military service in the Military Frontier.
The [Croatia](4797)n Parliament supported King Charles III's Pragmatic Sanction and signed their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712. Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of the Kingdom of [Croatia](4797), and Queen Maria Theresa made significant contributions to [Croatia](4797)n affairs, such as introducing compulsory education.

Between 1797 and 1809, the First French Empire increasingly occupied the eastern Adriatic coastline and its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response, the Royal Navy blockaded the [Adriatic Sea](3719), leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811. The Illyrian provinces were captured by the [Austria](1585)ns in 1813 and absorbed by the [Austria](1585)n Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to the formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and the restoration of the [Croatia](4797)n Littoral to the Kingdom of [Croatia](4797) under one crown. The 1830s and 1840s featured romantic nationalism that inspired the [Croatia](4797)n National Revival, a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of South Slavs within the empire. Its primary focus was establishing a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian while promoting [Croatia](4797)n literature and culture. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, [Croatia](4797) sided with [Austria](1585). Ban Josip Jelačić helped defeat the Hungarians in 1849 and ushered in a Germanisation policy.
By the 1860s, the failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The creation of a personal union between the [Austria](1585)n Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary followed. The treaty left [Croatia](4797)'s status to Hungary, which was resolved by the [Croatia](4797)n–Hungarian Settlement of 1868 when the kingdoms of [Croatia](4797) and Slavonia were united. The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto [Austria](1585)n control, while Rijeka retained the status of corpus separatum previously introduced in 1779.
After [Austria](1585)-Hungary occupied [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, the Military Frontier was abolished. The [Croatia](4797)n and Slavonian sectors of the Frontier returned to [Croatia](4797) in 1881, under provisions of the [Croatia](4797)n–Hungarian Settlement. Renewed efforts to reform [Austria](1585)-Hungary, entailing federalisation with [Croatia](4797) as a federal unit, were stopped by World War I.

The World Wars and Yugoslavia
On 29 October 1918, the [Croatia](4797)n Parliament (Sabor) declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The [Croatia](4797)n Parliament never ratified the union with Serbia and Montenegro. The 1921 constitution defining the country as a unitary state and abolition of [Croatia](4797)n Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended [Croatia](4797)n autonomy.
The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party—the [Croatia](4797)n Peasant Party (HSS) led by Stjepan Radić.
The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928, culminating in King Alexander I's establishment of the 6 January Dictatorship in 1929. The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution. The HSS, now led by Vladko Maček, continued to advocate federalisation, resulting in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of [Croatia](4797). The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the [Croatia](4797)n Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.

In April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Following the invasion, a German-Italian installed puppet state named the Independent State of [Croatia](4797) (NDH) was established. Most of [Croatia](4797), [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into this state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy, Hungary annexed the northern [Croatia](4797)n regions of Baranja and Međimurje. The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše, a fringe movement in pre-war [Croatia](4797). With German and Italian military and political support, the regime introduced racial laws and launched a genocide campaign against Serbs, Jews, and Roma. Many were imprisoned in concentration camps; the largest was the Jasenovac complex. Anti-fascist Croats were targeted by the regime as well. Several concentration camps (most notably the Rab, Gonars and Molat camps) were established in Italian-occupied territories, mostly for Slovenes and Croats. At the same time, the Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist Chetniks pursued a genocidal campaign against Croats and Muslims, aided by Italy. Nazi German forces committed crimes and reprisals against civilians in retaliation for Partisan actions, such as in the villages of Kamešnica and Lipa in 1944. 

A resistance movement emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied [Europe](1994). That sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist, multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. In ethnic terms, Croats were the second-largest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs. In per capita terms, Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia. By May 1944 (according to Tito), Croats made up 30% of the Partisan's ethnic composition, despite making up 22% of the population. The movement grew fast, and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943, the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.
With Allied support in logistics, equipment, training and airpower, and with the assistance of Soviet troops taking part in the 1944 Belgrade Offensive, the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of Italy and [Austria](1585) by May 1945. Members of the NDH armed forces and other Axis troops, as well as civilians, were in retreat towards [Austria](1585). Following their surrender, many were killed in the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators. In the following years, ethnic Germans faced persecution in Yugoslavia, and many were interned.
The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of [Croatia](4797), which developed in 1943 as the bearer of [Croatia](4797)n statehood and later transformed into the Parliament in 1945, and AVNOJ—its counterpart at the Yugoslav level.
Based on the studies on wartime and post-war casualties by demographer Vladimir Žerjavić and statistician Bogoljub Kočović, a total of 295,000 people from the territory (not including territories ceded from Italy after the war) died, which amounted to 7.3% of the population, among whom were 125–137,000 Serbs, 118–124,000 Croats, 16–17,000 Jews, and 15,000 Roma. In addition, from areas joined to [Croatia](4797) after the war, a total of 32,000 people died, among whom 16,000 were Italians and 15,000 were Croats. Approximately 200,000 Croats from the entirety of Yugoslavia (including [Croatia](4797)) and abroad were killed in total throughout the war and its immediate aftermath, approximately 5.4% of the population.

After World War II, [Croatia](4797) became a single-party socialist federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia, ruled by the Communists, but having a degree of autonomy within the federation. In 1967, [Croatia](4797)n authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the [Croatia](4797)n Standard Language demanding equal treatment for their language.
The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the [Croatia](4797)n Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the [Croatia](4797)n Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.
Following Tito's death in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated. National tension was fanned by the 1986 SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the [Croatia](4797)n faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in [Croatia](4797), while Franjo Tuđman's win exacerbated nationalist tensions. Some of the Serbs in [Croatia](4797) left Sabor and declared autonomy of the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from [Croatia](4797).

Independence
As tensions rose, [Croatia](4797) declared independence on 25 June 1991. However, the full implementation of the declaration only came into effect after a three-month moratorium on the decision on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked [Croatia](4797).

By the end of 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced [Croatia](4797)'s control to about two-thirds of its territory. Serb paramilitary groups then began a campaign of killing, terror, and expulsion of the Croats in the occupied territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and expelling or displacing as many as 400,000-500,000 Croats and other non-Serbs from their homes. Serbs living in [Croatia](4797)n towns, especially those near the front lines, were subjected to various forms of discrimination. [Croatia](4797)n Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina were forced to flee or were expelled by [Croatia](4797)n forces, though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers. The [Croatia](4797)n Government publicly deplored these practices and sought to stop them, indicating that they were not a part of the Government's policy. 

On 15 January 1992, [Croatia](4797) gained diplomatic recognition by the [Europe](1994)an Economic Community, followed by the United Nations. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by [Croatia](4797); the event is commemorated each year on 5 August as Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and the Day of [Croatia](4797)n Defenders. Following the [Croatia](4797)n victory, about 200,000 Serbs from the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina fled the region and hundreds of mainly elderly Serb civilians were killed in the aftermath of the military operation, often in revenge attacks. There were instances of their property being looted, seized or burned down. Approximately half have returned since then. Their homes were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571). The remaining occupied areas were restored to [Croatia](4797) following the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, concluding with the UNTAES mission in January 1998. Most sources number the war deaths at around 20,000.
After the end of the war, [Croatia](4797) faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, establishing democracy, protecting human rights, and general social and economic development.
The 2000s were characterized by democratization, economic growth, structural and social reforms, and problems such as unemployment, corruption, and the inefficiency of public administration. In November 2000 and March 2001, the Parliament amended the Constitution, first adopted on 22 December 1990, changing its bicameral structure back into its historic unicameral form and reducing presidential powers.
[Croatia](4797) joined the Partnership for Peace on 25 May 2000 and became a member of the World Trade Organization on 30 November 2000. On 29 October 2001, [Croatia](4797) signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the [Europe](1994)an Union, submitted a formal application for the EU membership in 2003, was given the status of a candidate country in 2004, and began accession negotiations in 2005. Although the [Croatia](4797)n economy had enjoyed a significant boom in the early 2000s, the financial crisis in 2008 forced the government to cut spending, thus provoking a public outcry.
[Croatia](4797) served on the United Nations Security Council in the 2008–2009 term for the first time, assuming the non-permanent seat in December 2008. On 1 April 2009, [Croatia](4797) joined NATO.

A wave of anti-government protests in 2011 reflected a general dissatisfaction with the current political and economic situation. The protests brought together diverse political persuasions in response to recent government corruption scandals and called for early elections. On 28 October 2011 MPs voted to dissolve Parliament and the protests gradually subsided. President Ivo Josipović agreed to a dissolution of Sabor on Monday, 31 October and scheduled new elections for Sunday 4 December 2011.
On 30 June 2011, [Croatia](4797) successfully completed EU accession negotiations. The country signed the Accession Treaty on 9 December 2011 and held a referendum on 22 January 2012, where [Croatia](4797)n citizens voted in favor of an EU membership. [Croatia](4797) joined the [Europe](1994)an Union on 1 July 2013.
[Croatia](4797) was affected by the [2015 [Europe](1994)an migrant crisis](1243) when Hungary's closure of borders with Serbia pushed over 700,000 refugees and migrants to pass through [Croatia](4797) on their way to other EU countries.
On 19 October 2016, Andrej Plenković began serving as the current [Croatia](4797)n Prime Minister. The most recent presidential elections, held on 5 January 2020, elected Zoran Milanović as president.
On 25 January 2022, the OECD Council decided to open accession negotiations with [Croatia](4797). Throughout the accession process, [Croatia](4797) was to implement numerous reforms that will advance all spheres of activity – from public services and the justice system to education, transport, finance, health, and trade. In line with the OECD Accession Roadmap from June 2022, [Croatia](4797) will undergo technical reviews by 25 OECD committees and is so far progressing at a faster pace than expected. Full membership is expected in 2025 and is the last big foreign policy goal [Croatia](4797) still has to achieve.
On 1 January 2023, [Croatia](4797) adopted the euro as its official currency, replacing the kuna, and became the 20th Eurozone member. On the same day, [Croatia](4797) became the 27th member of the border-free Schengen Area, thus marking its full EU integration.

Geography
[Croatia](4797) is situated in Central and Southeast [Europe](1994), on the coast of the [Adriatic Sea](3719). Hungary is to the northeast, Serbia to the east, [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) and Montenegro to the southeast and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) around Neum. The Pelješac Bridge connects the exclave with mainland [Croatia](4797).

The territory covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It is the world's 127th largest country. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border with [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571) in the south to the shore of the [Adriatic Sea](3719) which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular [Croatia](4797) consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size, 48 of which are permanently inhabited. The largest islands are Cres and Krk, each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles).
The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major rivers such as Danube, Drava, Kupa, and the Sava. The Danube, [Europe](1994)'s second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower. Karst topography makes up about half of [Croatia](4797) and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps. [Croatia](4797) hosts deep caves, 49 of which are deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). [Croatia](4797)'s most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.

Climate
Most of [Croatia](4797) has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification. Mean monthly temperature ranges between −3 °C (27 °F) in January and 18 °C (64 °F) in July. The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar featuring a snowy, forested climate at elevations above 1,200 metres (3,900 feet). The warmest areas are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by Mediterranean climate, as the sea moderates temperature highs. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in continental areas.
The lowest temperature of −35.5 °C (−31.9 °F) was recorded on 3 February 1919 in Čakovec, and the highest temperature of 42.8 °C (109.0 °F) was recorded on 4 August 1981 in Ploče.
Mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres (24 inches) and 3,500 millimetres (140 inches) depending on geographic region and climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Biševo, Lastovo, Svetac, Vis) and the eastern parts of Slavonia. However, in the latter case, rain occurs mostly during the growing season. The maximum precipitation levels are observed in the Dinaric Alps, in the Gorski Kotar peaks of Risnjak and Snježnik.
Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area, prevailing winds are determined by local features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as the cool northeasterly bura or less frequently as the warm southerly jugo. The sunniest parts are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern [Adriatic Sea](3719) area in general, and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year.

Biodiversity
[Croatia](4797) can be subdivided into ecoregions based on climate and geomorphology. The country is one of the richest in [Europe](1994) in terms of biodiversity. [Croatia](4797) has four types of biogeographical regions—the Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and Continental in the remaining areas. The most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The country contains three ecoregions: Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Illyrian deciduous forests.
The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate—the olm. Forests are abundant, covering 2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres) or 44% of [Croatia](4797)n land area. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.
In terms of phytogeography, [Croatia](4797) is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central [Europe](1994)an provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides [Croatia](4797) between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.
[Croatia](4797) hosts 37,000 known plant and animal species, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000. More than a thousand species are endemic, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. The most serious threat is habitat loss and degradation. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae. [Croatia](4797) had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.92/10, ranking it 113th of 172 countries.
Invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect benthic habitat. Indigenous cultivated plant strains and domesticated animal breeds are numerous. They include five breeds of horses, five of cattle, eight of sheep, two of pigs, and one poultry. Indigenous breeds include nine that are endangered or critically endangered. [Croatia](4797) has 444 protected areas, encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves, and ten nature parks. The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in [Croatia](4797) is Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network.

Governance
The Republic of [Croatia](4797) is a unitary, constitutional state using a parliamentary system. Government powers in [Croatia](4797) are legislative, executive, and judiciary powers.
The president of the republic ([Croatia](4797)n: Predsjednik Republike) is the head of state, directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to two terms. In addition to serving as commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the parliament and has some influence on foreign policy.
The Government is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers in charge of particular sectors. As the executive branch, it is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, enforcing the laws, and guiding foreign and internal policies. The Government is seated at Banski dvori in Zagreb.

Law and judicial system
A unicameral parliament (Sabor) holds legislative power. The number of Sabor members can vary from 100 to 160. They are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. Legislative sessions take place from 15 January to 15 July, and from 15 September to 15 December annually. The two largest political parties in [Croatia](4797) are the [Croatia](4797)n Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of [Croatia](4797).
[Croatia](4797) has a civil law legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving as implementers and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and [Austria](1585)n legal systems. [Croatia](4797)n law is divided into two principal areas—private and public law. Before EU accession negotiations were completed, [Croatia](4797)n legislation had been fully harmonised with the Community acquis.
The main national courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which is the highest court of appeal. Administrative, Commercial, County, Misdemeanor, and Municipal courts handle cases in their respective domains. Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. The State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.
Law enforcement agencies are organised under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior which consist primarily of the national police force. [Croatia](4797)'s security service is the Security and Intelligence Agency (SOA).

Foreign relations
[Croatia](4797) has established diplomatic relations with 194 countries. supporting 57 embassies, 30 consulates and eight permanent diplomatic missions. 56 foreign embassies and 67 consulates operate in the country in addition to offices of international organisations such as the [Europe](1994)an Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), International Organization for Migration (IOM), Organization for Security and Co-operation in [Europe](1994) (OSCE), World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and UNICEF.

As of 2019, the [Croatia](4797)n Ministry of Foreign Affairs and [Europe](1994)an Integration employed 1,381 personnel and expended 765.295 million kunas (€101.17 million). Stated aims of [Croatia](4797)n foreign policy include enhancing relations with neighbouring countries, developing international co-operation and promotion of the [Croatia](4797)n economy and [Croatia](4797) itself.
[Croatia](4797) is a member of the [Europe](1994)an Union. As of 2021, [Croatia](4797) had unsolved border issues with [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. [Croatia](4797) is a member of NATO. On 1 January 2023, [Croatia](4797) simultaneously joined both the Schengen Area and the Eurozone, having previously joined the ERM II on 10 July 2020.

[Croatia](4797)n diaspora
The [Croatia](4797)n diaspora consists of communities of ethnic Croats and [Croatia](4797)n citizens living outside [Croatia](4797). [Croatia](4797) maintains intensive contacts with [Croatia](4797)n communities abroad (e.g., administrative and financial support of cultural, sports activities, and economic initiatives). [Croatia](4797) actively maintain foreign relations to strengthen and guarantee the rights of the [Croatia](4797)n minority in various host countries.

Military
The [Croatia](4797)n Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the Air Force, Army, and Navy branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff, which reports to the defence minister, who in turn reports to the president. According to the constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In case of immediate threat during wartime, he issues orders directly to the General Staff.
Following the 1991–95 war, defence spending and CAF size began a constant decline. As of 2019, military spending was an estimated 1.68% of the country's GDP, 67th globally. In 2005 the budget fell below the NATO-required 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994. Traditionally relying on conscripts, the CAF went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation in the years before accession to NATO in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006, the CAF employed around 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between 18 and 30 years old in peacetime.
Until 2008 military service was obligatory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine months. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for eight months of civilian service. Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008, but is set to be reintroduced in January 2025 with two months of active duty. The decision was influenced by the rising tensions in [Europe](1994) and the region, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
As of May 2019, the [Croatia](4797)n military had 72 members stationed in foreign countries as part of United Nations-led international peacekeeping forces. As of 2019, 323 troops served the NATO-led ISAF force in [Afghanistan](1312). Another 156 served with KFOR in Kosovo.
[Croatia](4797) has a military-industrial sector that exported around 493 million kunas (€65,176 million) worth of military equipment in 2020. [Croatia](4797)n-made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt and the M-84D battle tank designed by the Đuro Đaković factory. Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are locally produced and marketed to other countries.
According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, [Croatia](4797) is the 15th most peaceful country in the world.

Administrative divisions
[Croatia](4797) was first divided into counties in the Middle Ages. The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, and Istria. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively.
Communist-ruled [Croatia](4797), as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing [Croatia](4797) into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions. In 1918, the Transleithanian part was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospić, Ogulin, Osijek, Požega, Varaždin, Vukovar, and Zagreb.

As of 1992, [Croatia](4797) is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the dual authority and legal status of a county and a city. County borders changed in some instances, last revised in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities. Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level considers the entire country in a single unit; three NUTS 2 regions come below that. Those are Northwest [Croatia](4797), Central and Eastern (Pannonian) [Croatia](4797), and Adriatic [Croatia](4797). The latter encompasses the counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest [Croatia](4797) includes Koprivnica-Križevci, Krapina-Zagorje, Međimurje, Varaždin, the city of Zagreb, and Zagreb counties and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) [Croatia](4797) includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Brod-Posavina, Karlovac, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Sisak-Moslavina, Virovitica-Podravina, and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in [Croatia](4797). The NUTS local administrative unit (LAU) divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to cities and municipalities.

Economy
[Croatia](4797)'s economy qualifies as high-income and developed. International Monetary Fund data projects that [Croatia](4797)n nominal GDP will reach $88.08 Billion in 2024, or $22,966 per capita. Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP will increase to $175.269 Billion, or $45,702 per capita. According to Eurostat, [Croatia](4797)n GDP per capita in PPS stood at 76% of the EU average in 2023, with real GDP growth for the year being 2.8%. The average net salary of a [Croatia](4797)n worker in April 2024 was €1,326 per month, the average gross salary roughly €1,834 per month. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.6% in that month, down from 7.2% in July 2019 and 9.6% in December 2018. The unemployment rate between 1996 and 2018 averaged 17.38%, reaching an all-time high of 23.60% in January 2002 and a record low of 8.40% in September 2018. In 2017, economic output was dominated by the service sector — accounting for 70.1% of GDP — followed by the industrial sector with 26.2% and agriculture accounting for 3.7%.
According to 2017 data, 1.9% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 27.3% by industry and 70.8% in services. Shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical, and timber industry dominate the industrial sector. In 2018, [Croatia](4797)n exports were valued at 108 Billion kunas (€14.61 Billion) with 176 Billion kunas (€23.82 Billion) worth of imports. [Croatia](4797)'s largest trading partner was the rest of the [Europe](1994)an Union, led by Germany, Italy, and Slovenia. According to Eurostat, [Croatia](4797) has the highest quantity of water resources per capita in the EU (30,000 m3).
As a result of the war, economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%. The [Croatia](4797)n state still controls significant economic sectors, with government expenditures accounting for 40% of GDP. A particular concern is a backlogged judiciary system, with inefficient public administration and corruption, upending land ownership. In the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, published by Transparency International, the country ranked 57th. At the end of June 2020, the national debt stood at 85.3% of GDP.

Tourism
Tourism dominates the [Croatia](4797)n service sector and accounts for up to 20% of GDP. Tourism income for 2019 was estimated to be €10.5 billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy, increasing retail business, and increasing seasonal employment. The industry is counted as an export business because foreign visitor spending significantly reduces the country's trade imbalance.
The tourist industry has rapidly grown, recording a sharp rise in tourist numbers since independence, attracting more than 17 million visitors each year (as of 2017). Germany, Slovenia, [Austria](1585), Italy, United Kingdom, Czechia, Poland, Hungary, France, [Netherlands](2285), Slovakia and [Croatia](4797) itself provide the most visitors. Tourist stays averaged 4.7 days in 2019.
Much of the tourist industry is concentrated along the coast. Opatija was the first holiday resort. It first became popular in the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it had become one of the largest [Europe](1994)an health resorts. Resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services catering to mass tourism and various niche markets. The most significant are nautical tourism, supported by marinas with more than 16 thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on the appeal of medieval coastal cities and cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer agrotourism, mountain resorts, and spas. Zagreb is a significant destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.
[Croatia](4797) has unpolluted marine areas with nature reserves and 116 Blue Flag beaches. [Croatia](4797) was ranked first in [Europe](1994) for swimming water quality in 2022 by [Europe](1994)an Environmental Agency.
[Croatia](4797) ranked as the 23rd-most popular tourist destination in the world according to the World Tourism Organization in 2019. About 15% of these visitors, or over one million per year, participate in naturism, for which [Croatia](4797) is famous. It was the first [Europe](1994)an country to develop commercial naturist resorts. In 2023, luggage storage company Bounce gave [Croatia](4797) the highest solo travel index in the world (7.58), while a joint Pinterest and Zola wedding trends report from 2023 put [Croatia](4797) among the most popular honeymoon destinations.

Infrastructure
Transport
The motorway network was largely built in the late 1990s and the 2000s. As of December 2020, [Croatia](4797) had completed 1,313.8 kilometres (816.4 miles) of motorways, connecting Zagreb to other regions and following various [Europe](1994)an routes and four Pan-[Europe](1994)an corridors. The busiest motorways are the A1, connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3, passing east to west through northwest [Croatia](4797) and Slavonia.
A widespread network of state roads in [Croatia](4797) acts as motorway feeder roads while connecting major settlements. The high quality and safety levels of the [Croatia](4797)n motorway network were tested and confirmed by EuroTAP and EuroTest programmes.
[Croatia](4797) has an extensive rail network spanning 2,604 kilometres (1,618 miles), including 984 kilometres (611 miles) of electrified railways and 254 kilometres (158 miles) of double track railways (as of 2017). The most significant railways in [Croatia](4797) are within the Pan-[Europe](1994)an transport corridors Vb and X connecting Rijeka to [Budapest](4580) and Ljubljana to Belgrade, both via Zagreb. [Croatia](4797)n Railways operates all rail services.

The construction of 2.4-kilometre-long Pelješac Bridge, the biggest infrastructure project in [Croatia](4797) connects the two halves of Dubrovnik-Neretva County and shortens the route from the West to the Pelješac peninsula and the islands of Korčula and Lastovo by more than 32 km. The construction of the Pelješac Bridge started in July 2018 after [Croatia](4797)n road operator Hrvatske ceste (HC) signed a 2.08 billion kuna deal for the works with a Chinese consortium led by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The project is co-financed by the [Europe](1994)an Union with 357 million euro. The construction was completed in July 2022.
There are international airports in Dubrovnik, Osijek, Pula, Rijeka, Split, Zadar, and Zagreb. The largest and busiest is Franjo Tuđman Airport in Zagreb. As of January 2011, [Croatia](4797) complies with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards and the Federal Aviation Administration upgraded it to Category 1 rating.

Ports
The busiest cargo seaport is the Port of Rijeka. The busiest passenger ports are Split and Zadar. Many minor ports serve ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities with ferry lines to several cities in Italy. The largest river port is Vukovar, located on the Danube, representing the nation's outlet to the Pan-[Europe](1994)an transport corridor VII.

Energy
610 kilometres (380 miles) of crude oil pipelines serve [Croatia](4797), connecting the Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, and several transhipment terminals.
The system has a capacity of 20 million tonnes per year. The natural gas transportation system comprises 2,113 kilometres (1,313 miles) of trunk and regional pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the Okoli natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems. [Croatia](4797) also plays an important role in regional energy security. The floating liquefied natural gas import terminal off Krk island LNG Hrvatska commenced operations on January 1, 2021, positioning [Croatia](4797) as a regional energy leader and contributing to diversification of [Europe](1994)'s energy supply.
In 2010, [Croatia](4797)n energy production covered 85% of nationwide natural gas and 19% of oil demand. In 2016, [Croatia](4797)'s primary energy production involved natural gas (24.8%), hydropower (28.3%), crude oil (13.6%), fuelwood (27.6%), and heat pumps and other renewable energy sources (5.7%). In 2017, net total electrical power production reached 11,543 GWh, while it imported 12,157 GWh or about 40% of its electric power energy needs.
Krško Nuclear Power Plant (Slovenia) supplies a large part of [Croatia](4797)n imports. 50% is owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, providing 15% of [Croatia](4797)'s electricity.

Demographics
With an estimated population of 3.87 million in 2021, [Croatia](4797) ranks 127th by population in the world. Its 2018 population density was 72.9 inhabitants per square kilometre, making [Croatia](4797) one of the more sparsely populated [Europe](1994)an countries. The overall life expectancy in [Croatia](4797) at birth was 76.3 years in 2018.
The total fertility rate of 1.41 children per mother, is one of the lowest in the world, far below the replacement rate of 2.1; it remains considerably below the high of 6.18 children rate in 1885. [Croatia](4797)'s death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate since 1998. [Croatia](4797) subsequently has one of the world's oldest populations, with an average age of 43.3 years. The population rose steadily from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million, with the exceptions of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e., following the world wars. The natural growth rate is negative with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s. In recent years, the [Croatia](4797)n government has been pressured to increase permit quotas for foreign workers, reaching an all-time high of 68.100 in 2019. In accordance with its immigration policy, [Croatia](4797) is trying to entice emigrants to return. From 2008 to 2018, [Croatia](4797)'s population dropped by 10%.
The population decrease was greater a result of war for independence. The war displaced large numbers of the population and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly occupied areas, more than 400,000 Croats were either removed from their homes by Serb forces or fled the violence. During the war's final days, about 150–200,000 Serbs fled before the arrival of [Croatia](4797)n forces during Operation Storm. After the war, the number of displaced persons fell to about 250,000. The [Croatia](4797)n government cared for displaced persons via the social security system and the Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees. Most of the territories abandoned during the war were settled by Croat refugees from [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), mostly from north-western Bosnia, while some displaced people returned to their homes.

According to the 2013 United Nations report, 17.6% of [Croatia](4797)'s population were immigrants. According to the 2021 census, the majority of inhabitants are Croats (91.6%), followed by Serbs (3.2%), Bosniaks (0.62%), Roma (0.46%), [Albania](1534)ns (0.36%), Italians (0.36%), Hungarians (0.27%), Czechs (0.20%), Slovenes (0.20%), Slovaks (0.10%), Macedonians (0.09%), Germans (0.09%), Montenegrins (0.08%), and others (1.56%). Approximately 4 million Croats live abroad.

Religion
[Croatia](4797) has no official religion. Freedom of religion is a Constitutional right that protects all religious communities as equal before the law and considers them separated from the state.

According to the 2011 census, 91.36% of [Croatia](4797)ns identify as Christian; of these, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows Eastern Orthodoxy (4.44%), Protestantism (0.34%), and other Christians (0.30%). The largest religion after Christianity is Islam (1.47%). 4.57% of the population describe itself as non-religious. In the Eurostat Eurobarometer Poll of 2010, 69% of the population responded that "they believe there is a God". In a 2009 Gallup poll, 70% answered yes to the question "Is religion an important part of your daily life?" Yet, only 24% of the population attends religious services regularly.

Languages
[Croatia](4797)n is the official language of the Republic of [Croatia](4797). Minority languages are in official use in local government units where more than a third of the population consists of national minorities or where local enabling legislation applies. Those languages are Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Serbian, and Slovak. The following minority languages are also recognised: [Albania](1534)n, Bosnian, [Bulgaria](4363)n, German, Hebrew, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Polish, Romanian, Istro-Romanian, Romani, Russian, Rusyn, Slovene, Turkish, and Ukrainian.
According to the 2011 Census, 95.6% of citizens declared [Croatia](4797)n as their native language, 1.2% declared Serbian as their native language, while no other language reaches more than 0.5%. [Croatia](4797)n is a member of the South Slavic languages and is written using the Latin alphabet. There are three major dialects spoken on the territory of [Croatia](4797), with standard [Croatia](4797)n based on the Shtokavian dialect. The [Chakavian](4751) and Kajkavian dialects are distinguished from Shtokavian by their lexicon, phonology and syntax.
A 2011 survey revealed that 78% of Croats claim knowledge of at least one foreign language. According to a 2005 EC survey, 49% of Croats speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, 14% speak Italian, 10% speak French, 4% speak Russian and 2% speak Spanish. However several large municipalities support minority languages. A majority of Slovenes (59%) have some knowledge of [Croatia](4797)n. The country is a part of various language-based international associations, most notably the [Europe](1994)an Union Language Association.

Education
Literacy in [Croatia](4797) stands at 99.2 per cent. Primary education in [Croatia](4797) starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades. In 2007 a law was passed to increase free, noncompulsory education until 18 years of age. Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school.
Secondary education is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools. As of 2019, there are 2,103 elementary schools and 738 schools providing various forms of secondary education. Primary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognised minorities in [Croatia](4797), where classes are held in Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Serbian, German and Slovak languages.
There are 133 elementary and secondary level music and art schools, as well as 83 elementary and 44 secondary schools for disabled children and youth and 11 elementary and 52 secondary schools for adults. Nationwide leaving exams ([Croatia](4797)n: državna matura) were introduced for secondary education students in the school year 2009–2010. It comprises three compulsory subjects ([Croatia](4797)n language, mathematics, and a foreign language) and optional subjects and is a prerequisite for university education.
[Croatia](4797) has eight public universities and two private universities. The University of Zadar, the first university in [Croatia](4797), was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807, when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002. The University of Zagreb, founded in 1669, is the oldest continuously operating university in Southeast [Europe](1994). There are also 15 polytechnics, of which two are private, and 30 higher education institutions, of which 27 are private. In total, there are 131 institutions of higher education in [Croatia](4797), attended by more than 160 thousand students.
There are 254 companies, government or education system institutions and non-profit organisations in [Croatia](4797) pursuing scientific research and development of technology. Combined, they spent around 3 billion kuna (€400 million) gross and employed 11,801 full-time research staff in 2016. Among the scientific institutes operating in [Croatia](4797), the largest is the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb. The [Croatia](4797)n Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb is a learned society promoting language, culture, arts and science from its inception in 1866. [Croatia](4797) was ranked 43rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.
The [Europe](1994)an Investment Bank provided digital infrastructure and equipment to around 150 primary and secondary schools in [Croatia](4797). Twenty of these schools got specialised assistance in the form of gear, software, and services to help them integrate the teaching and administrative operations.

Healthcare
[Croatia](4797) has a universal health care system, whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian-[Croatia](4797)n Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen.

Language
Standard [Croatia](4797)n is the official language of the Republic of [Croatia](4797), and became the 24th official language of the [Europe](1994)an Union upon its accession in 2013.
[Croatia](4797)n replaced Latin as the official language of the [Croatia](4797)n government in the 19th century. Following the Vienna Literary Agreement in 1850, the language and its Latin script underwent reforms to create an unified "[Croatia](4797)n or Serbian" or "Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n" standard, which under various names became the official language of Yugoslavia. In SFR Yugoslavia, from 1972 to 1989, the language was constitutionally designated as the "[Croatia](4797)n literary language" and the "[Croatia](4797)n or Serbian language". It was the result of a resistance to and secession from "Serbo-[Croatia](4797)n" in the form of the Declaration on the Status and Name of the [Croatia](4797)n Literary Language as part of the [Croatia](4797)n Spring. Since gaining independence in the early 1990s, the Republic of [Croatia](4797) constitutionally designates the language as "[Croatia](4797)n language" and regulates it through linguistic prescription. The long-standing aspiration to developing its own expressions, thus enriching itself, as opposed to taking over foreign solutions in the form of loanwords has been described as [Croatia](4797)n linguistic purism.
[Croatia](4797) introduced in 2021 a new model of linguistic categorisation of Bunjevac dialect (as New-Shtokavian Ikavian dialects of the Shtokavian dialect of the [Croatia](4797)n language) in three sub-branches: Dalmatian (also called Bosnian-Dalmatian), Danubian (also called Bunjevac), and Littoral-Lika. Its speakers largely use the Latin alphabet and are living in parts of [Bosnia and Herzegovina](4571), different parts of [Croatia](4797), southern parts (inc. [Budapest](4580)) of Hungary as well in the autonomous province Vojvodina of Serbia.
The Institute of [Croatia](4797)n Language and Linguistics added the Bunjevac dialect to the List of Protected Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Republic of [Croatia](4797) on 8 October 2021.

Culture
Because of its geographical position, [Croatia](4797) represents a blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroads of influences from western culture and the east since the schism between the Western Roman Empire and the [Byzantine Empire](3886), and also from Central [Europe](1994) and Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th century proved crucial to the emancipation of [Croatia](4797)ns and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to many historical figures.
The Ministry of Culture is tasked with preserving the nation's cultural and natural heritage and overseeing its development. Further activities supporting the development of culture are undertaken at the local government level.
