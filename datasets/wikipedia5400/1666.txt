Minsk Group proposals
After the OSCE summit in Lisbon, the [United States](1100) and France were appointed as co-chairs for the Minsk Group along with Russia. From the second half of 1997 to the present day, co-chairs of the Minsk Group made three proposals based on the principle of Lisbon summit about the return of seven districts located at out of Nagorno-Karabakh region to [Azerbaijan](1588) and determination of the legal status of Mountainous Garabagh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The first two proposals were rejected by [Armenia](1567) and the last one was not accepted by [Azerbaijan](1588):

Package
In this version, which was proposed in July 1997, envisaged simultaneous coordination of all issues including the determination of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, [Azerbaijan](1588) side rejected the proposal.

Stage
In this version proposed in September 1997, the way to resolve the conflict was in a staged manner. However, the [Armenia](1567)n side did not accept this proposal.

Common State solution
This proposal was based on the practice of the "Common State", which does not exist in the world practice. The idea of the "Common State" rejected by [Azerbaijan](1588) was an indication of indifference to the documents adopted at the OSCE Budapest and Lisbon meetings. As a result, it was not possible to achieve positive results in the solution of the conflict.
