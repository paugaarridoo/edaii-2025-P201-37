Armenia–OSCE relations
[Armenia](1567)–OSCE relations began when [Armenia](1567) joined the OSCE's predecessor, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), on 30 January 1992. The CSCE transformed into the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) shortly afterwards in 1995.

History
[Armenia](1567) is a full member of the OSCE having signed the Helsinki Accords on 8 July 1992 and the Paris Charter on 17 April 1992. [Armenia](1567) is also signatory to several OSCE conventions and treaties such as the Charter for European Security and the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, signed in 1999. An OSCE office was established in Yerevan on 16 February 2000 to further facilitate relations with [Armenia](1567). On 31 August 2017, the OSCE office in Yerevan discontinued its operations following [Azerbaijan](1588)'s decision to veto the extension of the office's mandate. After the closure of the OSCE Yerevan office, [Armenia](1567) and the OSCE Secretariat began negotiating a new framework of cooperation. The "[Armenia](1567) Cooperation Programme" was established with the aim to further develop relations between [Armenia](1567) and the OSCE.

OSCE Minsk Group
Since February 1992, the peaceful, negotiated resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has been a main focus of the OSCE in accordance with the principles of the organization. For this purpose, the OSCE Minsk Group was created in March 1992 to encourage dialogue between [Armenia](1567) and [Azerbaijan](1588) over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Minsk Group is headed by a co-chairmanship consisting of France, Russia, and the [United States](1100). Furthermore, the Minsk Group also includes the participating states of [Belarus](1683), Finland, Germany, Italy, [Sweden](1600), Turkey as well as [Armenia](1567) and [Azerbaijan](1588).
