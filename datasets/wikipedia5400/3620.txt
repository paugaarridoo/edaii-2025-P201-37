Ahmed Zewail
Ahmed Hassan Zewail (February 26, 1946 – August 2, 2016) was an [Egypt](1987)ian-American chemist, known as the "father of femtochemistry". He was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in [Chemistry](3696) for his work on femtochemistry and became the first [Egypt](1987)ian and Arab to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field, and the second African to win a Nobel Prize in [Chemistry](3696). He was the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of [Chemistry](3696), a professor of physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.

Early life and education
Ahmed Hassan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, [Egypt](1987), and was raised in Desouk. He received Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in chemistry from Alexandria University before moving to the [United States](1100) to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Robin M. Hochstrasser.

Career
After completing his PhD, Zewail did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Charles B. Harris. Following this, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, and eventually became the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics there. He became a naturalized citizen of the [United States](1100) on March 5, 1982. Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.

Zewail was nominated and participated in President [Barack Obama](3180)'s Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation's leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.

Research
Zewail's key work was a pioneer of femtochemistry—i.e. the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions. 
Zewail became known as the "father of femtochemistry". He also made critical contributions in ultrafast electron diffraction, which uses short electron pulses rather than light pulses to study chemical reaction dynamics.

Political work
In a speech at Cairo University on June 4, 2009, US President [Barack Obama](3180) proclaimed a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the [United States](1100) and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.When asked about rumors that he might contest the 2011 [Egypt](1987)ian presidential election, Ahmed Zewail said: "I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve [Egypt](1987) in the field of science and die as a scientist."
During the 2011 [Egypt](1987)ian protests he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside Ayman Nour, Mubarak's rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.
Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak's resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei. He played a critical role during this time as described by [Egypt](1987)ian Media.

Awards and honours
Zewail's work brought him international attention, receiving awards and honors throughout most of his career for his work in chemistry and physics. In 1999, Zewail became the first [Egypt](1987)ian to receive a science Nobel Prize when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in [Chemistry](3696). Zewail gave his Nobel Lecture on "Femtochemistry: Atomic-Scale Dynamics of the Chemical Bond Using Ultrafast Lasers".
In 1999, he received [Egypt](1987)'s highest state honour, the Grand Collar of the Nile. Other notable awards include the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award (1983), the King Faisal International Prize (1989), the Wolf Prize in [Chemistry](3696) (1993), the Earle K. Plyler Prize (1993), the Herbert P. Broida Prize (1995), the Peter Debye Award (1996), the Tolman Award (1997), the Robert A. Welch Award (1997), the Linus Pauling Medal (1997), the Franklin Medal (1998) and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2000). In October 2006, Zewail received the [Albert Einstein World Award of Science](3434) for "his pioneering development of the new field of femtoscience and for his seminal contributions to the revolutionary discipline of physical biology, creating new ways for better understanding the functional behavior of biological systems by directly visualizing them in the four dimensions of space and time." Zewail was awarded the Othmer Gold Medal (2009), the Priestley Medal (2011) from the [American Chemical Society](2806) and the Davy Medal (2011) from the Royal Society.
In 1982 he was named as a Fellow of the [American Physical Society](3451). Zewail became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1989, the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](3132) in 1993, and the [American Philosophical Society](3133) in 1998. Zewail was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2001. He was also elected as a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences in 2001.
Zewail was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 2005, the Ahmed Zewail Award for Ultrafast Science and Technology was established by the [American Chemical Society](2806) and the Newport Corporation in his honor. In 2010 the journal Chemical Physics Letters established the Ahmed Zewail Prize in Molecular Sciences. In May 2010, Zewail gave the commencement address at Southwestern University. The Zewail City of Science and Technology, established in 2000 and revived in 2011, is named in his honour.
