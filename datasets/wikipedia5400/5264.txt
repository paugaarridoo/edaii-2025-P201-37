Baghdadi Jews
[Baghdad](1667)i Jews or  Iraqi Jews are historic terms for the former communities of Jewish migrants and their descendants from [Baghdad](1667) and elsewhere in the Middle East.  They settled primarily in the ports and along the trade routes around the [India](2798)n Ocean and the South [China](2217) Sea.
Beginning under the Mughal Empire in the 18th century, merchant traders from [Baghdad](1667) and Aleppo established Judeo-Arabic speaking Jewish communities in [India](2798), then in a trading network across [Asia](1914), following Jewish customs. These flourished under the [British Empire](2056) in the 19th century, growing to be English-speaking and British oriented.
These grew into a tight trading and kinship network across [Asia](1914) with smaller [Baghdad](1667)i communities being established beyond [India](2798) in the mid-nineteenth century in Burma, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. [Baghdad](1667)i trading outposts were established further across [Asia](1914), and into Southeast [Asia](1914) and Oceania, with families settling in Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and [Australia](1659). Until the Second World War, these communities attracted a modest flow of Jewish emigrants from Iraq, with smaller numbers hailing from Syria, [Egypt](1987), Yemen, Iran, and Turkey.
The Second World War brought strife to [India](2798), the Japanese occupation of Burma, Hong Kong and Shanghai, then swiftly the end of the [British Empire](2056) in [Asia](1914). Dislocated by war, the violence of the [India](2798)n Partition, rising nationalism and the uncertainty of independence in both [India](2798) and Burma, an exodus began to the newly founded state of Israel, United Kingdom and [Australia](1659). Their old trade routes severed by first Communist victory in [China](2217), the ocean trade stifled in [India](2798) and Burma by postcolonial nationalizations and trade restrictions, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews had emigrated almost in their entirety by the 1970s. Families of [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish descent continue to play a major role in Jewish life, especially in Great Britain where families such as the Sassoons and Reubens have enjoyed great prominence in business and politics.

Precolonial origins
Though Jewish traders from the Middle East had crossed the [India](2798)n Ocean since ancient Rome, sources from the Mughal Empire first mention Jewish merchants from [Baghdad](1667) trading with [India](2798) in the 17th century.

[India](2798) was far from unknown to the Jewish merchants of the Middle East. Since ancient Rome the caravan route from [India](2798) had ended in Aleppo and the spice trade had tied Basra, Yemen and Cairo to the Malabar Coast. However, it was Persian-speaking Jewish merchants, close trading allies of the Jews of [Baghdad](1667), Basra and Aleppo Jews who first struck into the [India](2798)n heartland.
As adventurers, mystics and merchants, they had been venturing to [India](2798) since the Middle Ages on the back of invasions of the subcontinent launched by Persian speaking rulers from what is now Iran and [Afghanistan](1312). Both Persian and Mughal sources record Jewish traders following the 16th century Mughal invasion of [India](2798) launched by Emperor [Babur](5200).
They rose to be traders and courtiers of the Mughals. Jewish advisors at the Court of [Akbar](5132) the Great in Agra played a significant role in [Akbar](5132)'s liberal religious policies. In Delhi, the syncretic Jewish mystic Sarmad Khasani was tutor to the Crown Prince Dara Shikoh before both were executed by Aurangzeb. There were sufficient Jews in Mughal lands for British travelers to report that synagogues had been established there, but of which no trace or Jewish record remains. These handful of Jews never established a permanent community but left legends and pathways for future settlers from
Arabic speaking lands.
Records of Jewish tradesmen traveling from [Baghdad](1667) can be found from the early 17th century. These trading outposts and emerging migrant communities also saw Jews become courtiers to Mughal rulers. These merchants wandered widely across the subcontinent. Shalom Cohen, who would found the Calcutta community, was the court jeweller to the Nawab of Awadh and travelled to Punjab where he held the same title at the court of Ranjit Singh the leader of the Sikh Empire. Cohen, the Calcutta community would later recall, was even given the honour of riding with the Nawab of Awadh in his personal elephant.

The first permanent [Baghdad](1667)i merchant colony in [India](2798) was established in 1730 in Surat, after the British East [India](2798) Company had begun trading with Basra in 1723. In the early 18th century, trade between Basra and Surat grew whilst the [India](2798)n port was the main base of the British East [India](2798) Company until it decamped to Bombay. Joseph Seemah from [Baghdad](1667) opened the Surat synagogue and cemetery in 1730. The [Baghdad](1667)i community in Surat grew and by the end of the 18th century, as many as 100 Jews from [Baghdad](1667), Aleppo and Basra made up the Judeo-Arabic speaking merchant colony of Surat. This was to become the first of a string of [Baghdad](1667)i communities stretching from Bombay to Kobe be established in [Asia](1914).
But it was around the early 19th century, in response to the tyrannical rule of Dawud Pasha, the Ottoman governor of [Baghdad](1667), who persecuted, extorted and imprisoned the leading Jewish families of the city, that whole clans started crossing the [India](2798)n Ocean to seek safety and fortune in [Asia](1914). Dawud Pasha's misrule was when [Baghdad](1667)i immigration towards Bombay and Calcutta became strong with the leading Sassoon, Ezra and Judah families departing for [India](2798). This episode of persecution was the beginning of the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish diaspora with records of whole clans departing the city for Bombay, Calcutta, Aleppo, [Alexandria](1844) and Sydney.
Jewish life in the ancient communities of the Middle East, had taken a turn for the worse in the mid 19th century. The pogrom and forced conversion of the Jews of Mashhad in 1839, the fear sown by three blood libels in Aleppo between 1841 and 1860, and the outbreak of plague, first striking [Baghdad](1667) in 1831, then returning with vengeance to Basra and [Baghdad](1667) in 1841, encouraged Jewish clans in the declining Ottoman Empire to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

Colonial [Asia](1914)
As Jews, primarily from [Baghdad](1667), Basra and Aleppo came to [India](2798) as traders in the wake of the Portuguese, Dutch and British what became known as the [Baghdad](1667)i communities grew fast. By the middle of the 19th century trade between [Baghdad](1667) and [India](2798) was said to be entirely in Jewish hands. Within a generation [Baghdad](1667)i Jews had established manufacturing and commercial houses of fabulous wealth, most notably the Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Belilios, Judah and Meyer families.

With the rise of British power in [India](2798), Surat declined in importance as British-controlled Calcutta and Bombay became more important in trade.  [Baghdad](1667)i settlement shifted first to Bombay and then principally to Calcutta, then the capital of British [India](2798) and the centre of the jute, muslin, and opium trades. Jewish merchants from Aleppo, traditionally the end of the historic caravan route from [India](2798), played an important role in founding the Calcutta Jewish cemetery, which was opened in 1812.
Spurred by the immigration of some the leading Jewish families of [Baghdad](1667) fleeing the persecution of Dawud Pasha, the first synagogue, replacing a small prayer room, was opened in 1823, and with the community expanding quickly a second followed in 1856. By the end of the 19th century, more than 1,800 [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were living in Calcutta. In 1884, a third synagogue, which was to be the largest in [Asia](1914), was dedicated in Calcutta. [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were also living and trading in Chinsura and Chandernagore outside Calcutta.
The rise in prominence of Calcutta during the colonial era coincided with the rise of opium trade with [China](2217). The East [India](2798) Company established a monopoly over the sale of [India](2798)n opium in 1773, actively promoting the export of opium to [China](2217), defying prohibitory legislation from the Qing government. [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish merchants dominated the opium trade with a majority of opium chests auctioned from the colonial authorities being exported to [China](2217) by [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish merchants, who competed with Marwari and Parsee merchants for the trade. The Sassoon family eventually controlled 70 percent of the opium trade from [India](2798). Great fortunes were also made in the indigo, silk and muslin trade with Dhaka where [Baghdad](1667)i Jews partnered with Bengali Muslim merchants.
Around these booming concerns, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish communities of [India](2798) began to take shape, both seeking and attracting Jewish immigrants from across the Middle East to work for them. Following the shift in the centre of British rule from Bombay to Bengal the [Baghdad](1667)i community of Bombay initially lagged that emerging in Calcutta. This fortunes of the community were reversed when David Sassoon and his family arrived in 1833.
Sponsored by the Sassoon family, the first synagogue opened in 1861 and the second in 1888. Distinct from Calcutta, whose settlement was principally Iraqi Jews and Syrian Jews, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish community in Bombay drew significant Jewish immigration from Persian-speaking communities in [Afghanistan](1312), Bukhara and Iran as well Jewish families from Yemen. Jewish migrant were attracted from across the Middle East to work in the factories and business concerns of the Sassoon family. Outside Bombay a [Baghdad](1667)i community was established in Poona where a synagogue, a school and hospital was established by David Sassoon and a Hebrew printing press was in operation. A [Baghdad](1667)i presence is also recorded in Madras.

From [India](2798), the community expanded to Burma, and the ports of Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. These were established along the opium route that ran between [India](2798) and [China](2217). In Singapore the elders of the community were initially the sons of Ezekiel Judah of Calcutta. Meanwhile, the earliest [Baghdad](1667)i Jew to settle in Burma was Azariah Samuel who arrived in the port of Sittwe on the Bay of Bengal in 1841. Around the same time two brothers Judah and Abraham Raphael Ezekiel settled in Mandalay and worked as bookkeepers for the Burmese royal court. From 1880 the community was permanently established, the trading success of other [Baghdad](1667)i Jews in opium, teak, jute, and trading shops, attracted other [Baghdad](1667)i Jews to Mandalay and communities sprang up in Rangoon and Pathein.
Following the ban on the opium trade in the early twentieth century [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish merchants invested in cotton and jute products as staple exports. The sudden spike in demand for jute sandbags, building blocks for the trenches on the Western Front (World War I), made great fortunes amongst the Jewish merchants of Calcutta.
At their heights, the communities of Bombay and Calcutta were at the heart of a communal kinship network linked by the ports of the [India](2798)n Ocean and South [China](2217) Sea. One observer described the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews communities as being "almost as familiar with each other as the Jews of Manchester are with Liverpool." The engines of the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish trading network were tightly knit family firms such as David Sassoon and Co or the Meyer Brothers, founded by Sir Manasseh Meyer, with offices and agents established by family members in the each port of the network.
Before World War II there were upwards of 11,000 [Baghdad](1667)i Jews in [Asia](1914). On the eve of war the [Baghdad](1667)i population in Calcutta had reached 3500 and in Bombay 3000. Across the Bay of Bengal in Burma, both Rangoon and Pathein elected [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish mayors and the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish population peaked at 2500 Jews in the 1930s. However, not all the Baghadi Jewish communities of this era were permanently established with the Judeo-Arabic speaking community in Sydney established by families fleeing Dawud Pasha disbanding its congregation in the 1890s.

Those communities established beyond British [India](2798) by [Baghdad](1667)i Jews flourished during the [British Empire](2056) and peaked in population shortly before the Second World War at 1500 in Singapore, 1000 in Shanghai, and 150 Hong Kong prior to the Second World War. The Singapore community flourished under the leadership of Sir Menasseh Meyer and the Hong Kong community under the influence of E. R. Belilios. Both were opium merchants who engaged in significant philanthropic efforts establishing schools and synagogues. [Baghdad](1667)i outposts are also recorded as having been established in Canton and Tientsin.
Whilst Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai were the only [Baghdad](1667)i settlements to genuinely grow into large communities, beyond a small trading outpost, tiny portside settlements existed in Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan, as satellites of the stronger communities in [India](2798), Burma, Singapore and [China](2217).
On the route between [India](2798) and Singapore, a tiny [Baghdad](1667)i community was in Penang, with a synagogue and Jewish cemetery, was established in the 1870s, but for most of its history never exceeded 50 families. Further south from Singapore, in Indonesia, then the Dutch East Indies, a tiny [Baghdad](1667)i community of spice merchants was established in Surabaya in Java in the 1880s.

The most far flung [Baghdad](1667)i outposts, never numbering more than fifty families, were established in Japan at the furthest reaches of the opium route. [Baghdad](1667)i Jews from Iraq, Syria and [Egypt](1987), initially drawn to man the concessions of David Sassoon established tiny footholds in Nagasaki, Yokohama and Kobe. The only [Baghdad](1667)i synagogue in Japan, uniting small prayer groups, was Ohel Shelomoh opened by Jews from Aleppo in 1912. Initially established in Nagasaki and Yokohama, the [Baghdad](1667)i traders relocated to Kobe, which became its focal point, after an earthquake in 1923.
As imperial jurisdictions consolidated, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews found themselves in a liminal situation in colonial [Asia](1914). They were considered neither [India](2798)n nor Western, [Asia](1914)n nor [Europe](1994)an and partnered with both Western and [India](2798)n interests. Legally they lived in limbo, their citizenship often unclear, having inherited what was an early modern political order.
Prior to the First World War the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were for the most part notionally subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Starting from 1870 the communal leaders began aggressive lobbying with British colonial authorities to registered as [Europe](1994)an. This was never granted to them. Nor was admittance, with few exceptions, to the [Europe](1994)an-only clubs that were the center of life in the [Europe](1994)an colonial societies throughout [Asia](1914). [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were denied access to [Europe](1994)an electoral rolls in [India](2798). Outsiders, and insiders, they clung fiercely to their Jewish identity.
Beyond [India](2798), [Baghdad](1667)i Jews sought the legal status of French or British Protected Person in [China](2217). With few exceptions for the wealthiest individuals, this was routinely denied by British government officials. Angst over their legal status grew in the run up to World War II.
As a result, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were determined to prove themselves a loyalist community to British authorities throughout the colonial period. [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish merchants operated as confidential agents of the East [India](2798) Company, offered aid to British soldiers during the 1756 incident known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and like many foreign and [India](2798)n merchants and maharajas made substantial donations to the British military during the so-called 1857 [India](2798)n Mutiny. God Save The Queen, was sung in the honour of the far off imperial sovereign in the schools founded by David Sassoon, who himself never spoke English.

[Baghdad](1667)i culture
The [Baghdad](1667)i Jews, whilst spread across continents, operated a network of kinship and trust throughout the trading posts of the [India](2798)n Ocean. They were closely united by religious, language and family ties. Marriage, in particular, tied the [Baghdad](1667)i communities together. Brides, and occasionally grooms, would be sent from one community to another. Business would often overlap with family ties, creating strong alliances. Synagogues, schools, and special funds, fastened a support networks sponsored by wealthy merchants. This kinship network meant Judeo-Arabic communities, typically established by fellow Jewish migrants from the same families and clans the Middle East, which sprang up in Burma, Singapore, Malaysia and [China](2217), were tightly woven into the [Baghdad](1667)i community.

The life of the [Baghdad](1667)i kinship network on the opium route is best seen in the case of Sir Manasseh Meyer. He was born in [Baghdad](1667) in 1846 and received his primary education of Calcutta, his secondary education in Singapore, before returning to Calcutta to learn bookkeeping and then moving to Rangoon, Burma, to established a small business. From there he returned to Singapore, established an import-export business, based on an opium monopoly with [India](2798). He was knighted in 1906 for his services to Singapore having sponsored the building of two synagogues and large scale real estate construction. However, throughout all his movement, he remained firmly within a Judeo-Arabic speaking [Baghdad](1667)i network.

Within these [Baghdad](1667)i communities, the majority were of Iraqi Jewish origin, but families from Syria, Yemen, [Egypt](1987), [Afghanistan](1312), Iran and a handful of Sephardic Jews from Italy and Turkey joined and assimilated into the [Baghdad](1667)i community. For most, it was simply as eastern expansion to closely bound patterns of transnational Jewish kinship, trade and exchange that had existed for centuries, moved out of the Middle East and the Mediterranean into colonial [Asia](1914). Within the Middle Eastern Jewish world, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews were considered adventurers and entrepreneurs.
Quite unlike [Ashkenazi Jews](3098) departing for [America](1163), who were typically poor and scorned by their religious elders for doing so, the Mizrahi Jews who departed for [India](2798) included some of the leading Jewish families of [Baghdad](1667), and were looked up as admired figures, patrons, and sponsors of religious life back in Iraq. Both the Sassoon family, which settled in Bombay no later than 1832, and the Judah family, which left for Calcutta in 1825, were seen as the leading Jewish families of [Baghdad](1667). Ezekiel Judah, who founded two synagogues in Calcutta, was a descendant of Solomon Ma'tuk.
These great [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish fortunes are deceptive, however, when it comes to what life was like for the overwhelming majority of the community. Far from wealthy, they lived on the edge of poverty, as peddlers, stall holders, mill workers, rickshaw men and other such jobs. The middle class Jews speculated in opium and acted as brokers. Great distance existed between the leading [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish families, such as the Ezra family and the Sassoon family, who grew ever richer and more British-oriented during this period, and the rest of the community. Politically, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish resembled an oligarchy, with all power and authority to represent the community towards colonial authorities being vested in the leading families, as it had been traditionally in the Middle East.
Initially the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish communities that developed in [India](2798) retained close cultural and religious links to [Baghdad](1667). Intellectual life was strong enough in the mid to late-19th century to sustain a printed press in [India](2798) of the [Baghdad](1667) Jewish dialect of Judeo-Arabic. Centered on Calcutta small [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish publishing houses translated literary, historical, religious and anti-missionary tracts into Judeo-Arabic whilst religious texts were also printed in Hebrew. [Baghdad](1667)i newspapers and periodicals in Judeo-Arabic, with some Hebrew portions, were also published in [India](2798). This [Baghdad](1667)i printed press began in 1855: with the support of David Sassoon a periodical started in Bombay catering to the merchant elite of the community. This was joined by four other [Baghdad](1667)i Judeo-Arabic newspapers and periodicals in Calcutta. Novels and literature from the [Europe](1994)an Zionist and Haskala movements were translated into Judeo-Arabic in Calcutta. At the turn of the 20th century, Jewish intellectual life in Calcutta appears to have waned.

In the 20th century [Baghdad](1667) declined, and the [British Empire](2056) became more important to the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews. The wealthier [Baghdad](1667)is adopted [Europe](1994)an clothes and sought British education for their children whilst the poorer [Baghdad](1667)is, especially women, continued to wear Arabic dress. The rise in British education and working in the [British Empire](2056) resulted in [Baghdad](1667)i Jews turning to English as their first language, both for international trade and cultural prestige in [India](2798). In the 20th century the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews wanted to assimilate into colonial [Europe](1994)an society and be considered culturally and ethnically [Europe](1994)an. Aside for religious observances, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews began to adopt elements of Western [Europe](1994)an lifestyles. But the [Baghdad](1667)is remained marginal to colonial [Europe](1994)an society and were excluded for the duration of the Raj from many social clubs that limited admission to [Europe](1994)ans.
Such Westernization resulted in the closing of all Judeo-Arabic publications in [India](2798) by the start of the 20th century. These were succeeded in Calcutta in the 1920s and 1940s by three English-language communal newspapers sympathetic to Zionism. Whilst many of the wealthiest [Baghdad](1667)i families remained aloof from Zionism in the late 19th and early 20th century, the community's middle class established Zionist associations in Bombay and Calcutta.
Religiously the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews did not train their own rabbis but sought guidance and resolutions on matters of Jewish law from the rabbis of [Baghdad](1667), preserving the traditions and rituals of Iraqi Jews. Sermons up until the First World War were given in Judeo-Arabic, after which the use of English became predominant. After the First World War, the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews began to refer their religious questions to the Sephardic Chief Rabbi in Britain. Rites concerning circumcision, betrothal, and protections of the newborn preserved Iraqi Jewish customs. [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish wedding celebrations gradually grew less Middle Eastern and more [Europe](1994)an in style in the 20th century.
Throughout this period, the leading [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish families set themselves up as sponsors of Jewish religious life in the Middle East. Across Syria and Iraq, schools, synagogues, yeshiva and charitable foundations were supported by [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish merchants of Bombay and Calcutta. Struggling communities across the Middle East sought the support of patrons in [Asia](1914) such as when Moise Sassoon of Calcutta was called upon to by Lebanese Jews to sponsor the construction of the Magen Avraham Synagogue of Beirut. Almost all these works were destroyed after the starts or the Israeli-Arab conflict brought about the flight and expulsion of these ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Today only the Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem, founded by donations from the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews of Calcutta, survives.

Postcolonial decline
As the Second World War saw most of the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews of Burma, as well as individual families from across [Asia](1914), flee from the Japanese Occupation of Burma the Jewish population of Calcutta, the heart of the [Baghdad](1667)i network, swelled with refugees to over 5,000 strong. A small number of Jews fled the 1941 Farhud pogrom in [Baghdad](1667) for Bombay. Even some of the leading [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish families who had settled in Britain chose to return to [India](2798) as the Holocaust began the slaughter of [Europe](1994)an Jews. Despite [India](2798) offering this place of refuge, the Second World War was the beginning of the end for old [Baghdad](1667)i world.
The Japanese occupation of Burma, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia saw much of the [Baghdad](1667)i community interned by the Japanese army. As the war ended, it was miraculously revealed to the rest of the [Baghdad](1667)i world that in Japan itself, Rahmo Sassoon, leader of the tiny [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish community of Kobe, had skillfully negotiated with Japanese authorities to ensure no Jews were harmed during World War II. Despite this, the one [Baghdad](1667)i synagogue of Japan, in Kobe was burnt down during an [America](1163)n air raid.
At the heart of the [Baghdad](1667)i world, in [India](2798), the end of the war ushered in the implosion of the old order. At this point, ethnic strife, political violence and fear of civil war were widespread in [India](2798) on the eve of [India](2798)n Independence. The violent explosion of killings and refugees following the Partition of [India](2798) exacerbated the [Baghdad](1667)i fears for the future. Dislocated by war, with many fearing [India](2798) and Burma would become communist or hostile to business not in [India](2798)n hands or Burmese hands once the British left, the [Baghdad](1667)i community began to leave [Asia](1914). Meanwhile, in the Middle East the establishment of the state of Israel and the outbreak of the Arab–Israeli conflict saw the start of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands. In Iraq, pushed by official intimidation persecution, almost the entirety of the ancient Iraqi Jewish community had left for Israel by 1950.

First the leading families, then the rest of the community began to emigrate on mass. This began a continuous exodus from Bombay and Calcutta. The wealthier followed the path of the Sassoon family to Britain, whilst the poorer were drawn to the new state of Israel or the easing of immigration restrictions in [Australia](1659). Bombay and Calcutta were the heart of the [Baghdad](1667)i world, the centers of trade, culture and communal life. Once these had fallen into decline, the outlying communities followed.
Postwar the imperial system and open borders that had made the transnational [Baghdad](1667)i world possible disappeared. In Shanghai, communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 closed the trading links community depended upon. Those that has fled the Japanese occupation chose not to return. By 1950, the community had all but vanished. Meanwhile, In Hong Kong, despite the benign conditions of British rule, emigration saw [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish numbers fall to less than 70 by the 1960s.
In Burma, independence in 1947 similarly imposed trade barrier and a nationalistic regime in which the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews felt they had little place.  In Singapore, with trade to [China](2217), [India](2798) and Burma blocked, and the Jewish community had shrunk to as low as 180 by the 1960s.
A final wave of emigration, pushing the much reduced communities in [India](2798) and Burma to virtual extinction, was triggered by a wave of post-colonial nationalizations and trade restrictions in [India](2798) and Burma in the 1960s. Elections in West Bengal saw a government dominated by the Communist Party of [India](2798) (Marxist) take power in Calcutta in 1967. Nationalizations of legacy firms established during the colonial rule and currency restrictions saw a choking of economic life and the [Baghdad](1667)i community shrink from 500 to under 100 by the 1970s. Meanwhile, nationalizations in Burma the 1960s saw the closing of synagogues and the last Rabbi leaving the country in 1969.
Despite this precipitous decline and dispersal of the [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish communities, a handful of individual [Baghdad](1667)i Jews would play pivotal roles in [Asia](1914)'s newly independent states. The first First Minister of Singapore David Marshall was a [Baghdad](1667)i Jew. In [India](2798), Lieutenant General J. F. R. Jacob, a [Baghdad](1667)i Jew from Calcutta, won national fame as Major General and chief of staff of the [India](2798)n army that defeated the Pakistan Army in East Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, later serving as governor of the [India](2798)n states of Goa and Punjab.
The [Baghdad](1667)i community, however, never saw their exodus as a tragedy. Memoirs written by [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish authors spoke fondly Burma, Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong and of the fact in [India](2798) they had never experienced antisemitism, which was viewed as a unique treasure. The network of [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish schools, both English, Jewish and aspirational in orientation had primed them for life in Britain or Israel, not in post-colonial [Asia](1914). Rather that focus on what pushed, these memoirs focus on what pulled the [Baghdad](1667)i Jews to leave [Asia](1914), chiefly a sense that the opportunities that had drawn their ancestors there had dried up, and new glittering prizes lay in the West.
In the early twenty first century the [Baghdad](1667)i communities of [India](2798) and Burma are at the point of disappearing completely. However small [Baghdad](1667)i communities of Hong Kong and Singapore have endured and [Baghdad](1667)i synagogues still operate in both cities, though now greatly outnumbered in both by Jews from especially the [United States](1100), Israel, France and the United Kingdom draw to business in contemporary [Asia](1914).
Today synagogues and associations upholding [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish traditions exist in Britain, Israel, [Australia](1659) and the [United States](1100). But in the historic [Baghdad](1667)i communities in [Asia](1914) only the synagogues originally founded by [Baghdad](1667)i Jews in both Hong Kong and Singapore continue to operate regular services.

Families of [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish descent continue to play a major role in Jewish life particularly in Great Britain, to which the leading families were drawn after the Second World War. Established in London, the Sassoon family enjoyed the friendship of Edward VII, established a baronetcy and saw Philip Sasson became a minister.

Traditional [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish cuisine is a hybrid cuisine, with many Arab, Turkish, Persian and [India](2798)n influences. Famous [Baghdad](1667)i dishes include beef curry, [Baghdad](1667)i biryani and [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish parathas. A [Baghdad](1667)i version of tandoori chicken is also popular (using lemon juice to cook the chicken instead of the cream used in the usual [India](2798)n recipe). Other [Baghdad](1667)i Jewish communities in Southeast [Asia](1914) mixed their original Iraqi Jewish dishes with influences from the local cuisine.
