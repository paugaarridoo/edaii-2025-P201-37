Adelbert von Chamisso Prize
The [Adelbert von Chamisso](3029) Prize (German: Adelbert-von-Chamisso-Preis) was a German literary award established in 1985, given to a work whose author's mother tongue is not German, as was the case for [Adelbert von Chamisso](3029). It was offered by the Robert Bosch Stiftung.
In addition to the main prize with a prize money of €15,000, one or more promotional prizes ("Förderpreise") with a prize money of €7,000 and sometimes an honorary award ("Ehrengabe") were given.
The prize was created by Harald Weinrich.
In 2016, the Robert Bosch Stiftung announced that the prize would be discontinued after the final 2017 award, saying that it had now fulfilled its original objective.
