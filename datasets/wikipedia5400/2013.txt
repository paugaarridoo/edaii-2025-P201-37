AFL Commission
The AFL Commission is the governing body of the [Australia](1659)n Football League Limited (AFL), its subsidiaries and controlled entities. Richard Goyder has been chairman since 4 April 2017, replacing Mike Fitzpatrick.
It was formed in 1985 as the VFL Commission, and gained its current name in 1990 in conjunction with the renaming of the VFL competition to the [Australia](1659)n Football League. 
Its constitution self-proclaims the commission to be the "keeper of the code" responsible for the sport of [Australia](1659)n football. As part of its role, the Commission is responsible for the Laws of [Australia](1659)n Football. It is also responsible for worldwide player acknowledgement through the [Australia](1659)n Football Hall of Fame, All-[Australia](1659)n team and World (formerly All-International) Team. 
The Commission controls the AFL competition and maintains a professional talent pathway for players through the AFL Draft, AFL Draft Combine, AFL Academy and academies through its member clubs and affiliated bodies, Underage Men's and Underage Women's championships, the [Australia](1659)n Football (AFL) International Cup and through its worldwide affiliates, numerous regional representative tournaments. 
The Commission organises the highest level of representative competition in [Australia](1659), being responsible for senior State of Origin competition from 1991 to its cessation in 1999. Since  1998, it has also overseen [Australia](1659)'s involvement in the International Rules Series.

History
An independent governing body for the competition was first moved in December 1984 during the fallout of VFL president Allen Aylett's resignation following the South Melbourne Football Club's financially disastrous move to Sydney. The club, managed from Melbourne but playing in Sydney, had lost large amounts of money in Sydney and large loans had been written out by the league to keep them viable which was impacting the finances of the competition.
Under Jack Hamilton, the first Chief Commissioner, the VFL began a restructuring toward a franchise model whereby member clubs operate licenses owned by the league. The model helped make private ownership of the Swans possible in 1985, as well as selling new licenses (resulting in the Brisbane Bears and West Coast Eagles in 1987). Under the new model, many Melbourne clubs struggling for financial viability such as St Kilda, Fitzroy and North Melbourne could be kept afloat by a combination of private ownership and league subsidies from the sale of new franchises and television rights. The restructuring paved the way for the VFL's expansion into a national competition. Despite continuing financial troubles at many clubs including the Swans and Footscray, the Commission was able to turn the competition's finances around by 1989, aided by increased television rights and the sale of $4 million licenses to interstate expansion clubs. Under the VFL Commission, all players became fully professional for the first time in its history.

Scope of governance
The AFL Commission has been responsible for the administration of the AFL competition since 1993, when the AFL Board of Directors voted itself out of existence after 96 years of operation. Its constitution self-proclaims the Commission to be the "keeper of the code" responsible for the sport of [Australia](1659)n football. 
The Commission later became  responsible for the national administration of the sport (since 1995, when the [Australia](1659)n National Football Council ceased operations after 89 years), as well as its international administration (since 2002, when it absorbed the International [Australia](1659)n Football Council) and the administration of women's football (since 2010, when it took over the operations of Women's Football [Australia](1659), which ceased operations in 2015).
Leagues affiliated with or owned by the AFL Commission have names beginning with AFL, and incorporate the AFL logo, and now owns the governing body for [Australia](1659)'s most populous eastern region through the AFL NSW/ACT and has strong affiliations with all other states. The AFL also promotes and brands the sport under its own name instead of the official name of [Australia](1659)n Football, especially in developing areas where the sport is not well known and the AFL has a major stake in the local governing bodies.
The ten commissioners are elected by the 18 AFL clubs, with each of the 18 clubs entitled to make nominations, but other [Australia](1659)n Football leagues, associations and clubs do not have any control or representation.
The AFL Commission's primary role is to oversee the profitability of its competitions, its primary competitions being the AFL and AFL Women's. As such, it has a direct stake in many of its member clubs. 
It also approves the administration of new club licenses, and has been involved in the expansion of the national competition since 1987, being instrumental in the merger that created the Brisbane Lions. The Commission also fully owns the Greater Western Sydney Giants. Other clubs to have an AFL Commission appointed board include the Sydney Swans, the Gold Coast Suns, Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club. The Commission operates a Competitive Balance Fund, which redistributes profits to the clubs most in need to help ensure that all of its member clubs are financially sustainable in the long-term.
Financially, the Commission is highly co-dependent on the success of the AFL and the majority of its funding comes from AFL competition broadcasting rights. The 2025-2031 rights will earn $4.5 billion, the most lucrative in [Australia](1659)n sporting history. The Commission distributes some of the profit from these rights into development of the game.
However, the majority is invested in ensuring that the AFL continues to sustain its future revenues, such as protecting the primacy of the competition, as well as growing its broadcast audience, talent pathways and professionalism to attract the best available players (from junior development programs and high performance athletes from around the world).
As part of its role, the Commission is responsible for the [Australia](1659)n Football Hall of Fame, the AFL men's underage championships and AFL Women's underage championships. It was also responsible for senior State of Origin competition from 1991 until it ended in 1999.

Role in national and international game development
The Commission was formed to set policy, and has directed the VFL/AFL (known then as the VFL) as the game's most professional league since December 1985.
In 1993, the AFL Commission assumed control of the league's administration from the AFL Board of Directors (in effect, the 15 AFL clubs at that time). Subsequently, the board of directors voted itself out of existence, and a new Memorandum and Articles of Association were adopted for the AFL. It also assumed national governance of the sport (see Principle 2 below) after the ANFC ceased operations in 1995.
This was a significant change of power: between 1985 and 1993, the Commission had required explicit approval by a 75% vote of the League (the teams) for major items such as further expansion, mergers, relocations, and major capital works.
The AFL also created an International Policy in 2005, and absorbed the International [Australia](1659)n Football Council, thus gaining control of the sport worldwide.
In its role as national and international governing body, the AFL Commission also controls and delegates development funding for [Australia](1659)n state and international bodies and leagues. As most of this funding is sourced the revenue and activities associated with the AFL competition, much of the funding is directed to the competition's developing markets. Semi-professional state competitions are generally self-sufficient, and receive a much lower percentage of the AFL's funding. The Commission has established a pathway that features junior Academies and scholarships from representational level up to its member clubs. The highest level is the AFL Academy, with academies for each state being managed by their respective AFL clubs and affiliated governing bodies.
Between 2010 and 2021, the AFL spent between $6–38 million per annum (under 5% of total revenue) on game development grants globally (excluding a one-off COVID-19 Pandemic community football recovery package). With a new TV rights deal in 2022 and to help the game at the grassroots continue its recovery post COVID-19 Pandemic, the Commission increased its community grants to $67 million.

Organisation structure and members
The AFL Commission has a simple structure. There are formal corporate titles for members which currently consists of a chairman, whose role is to oversee meetings, and a chief executive officer, who typically also oversees the operations of the [Australia](1659)n Football League.
Commissioners are elected by the 18 AFL clubs, who each are entitled to make nominations.  Should an election be necessary, then the membership is decided by a vote of the AFL clubs. Under the current constitution, the member clubs have the power to veto commission decisions with a two-thirds majority vote.

Club and Competition Intervention
The AFL Commission has also become involved in [Australia](1659)n Football League matters on occasion, both on and off-field. Sometimes these interventions have been in controversial circumstances.

On the field
The "Line in the Sand" match in 2004 in which 18 players were reported on 26 charges arising from a third-quarter brawl. Four Hawthorn players were suspended for a total of 15 matches while Essendon's Justin Murphy was suspended for one match.
Criticism from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou and Network 10 commentators Stephen Quartermain, Tim Lane and Robert Walls of Paul Roos' style of coaching after the Sydney Swans' 43-point loss to St Kilda in round 10 of the 2005 season.

A successful appeal from the AFL saw the suspension increased to six matches.
The three-match suspension handed to Port Adelaide player Jeremy Finlayson after he admitted to making a homophobic slur towards an Essendon player in round four of the 2024 AFL season.
The five-match suspension handed to Port Adelaide player Dan Houston for his crude bump on Adelaide's Izak Rankine in round 23 of the 2024 AFL season.

Salary cap breaches by the Carlton Football Club in 2002 which hampered the club from rebuilding its playing list in the following years.
2007 investigation into the West Coast Eagles party in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, after the 2006 AFL Grand Final.  During the Las Vegas parties, Ben Cousins rehabilitation from drug addiction, Daniel Kerr's criminal charges and the hospitalisation of Chad Fletcher after choking on his own vomit were part of the issues following the overseas trip.
The trading out of Brendan Fevola from the Carlton Football Club over his behaviour at the 2009 Brownlow Medal function.
The sacking of Richmond player Daniel Connors over repeated off-field infringements during his playing career with the club, including a drunken rampage in Sydney in 2010 and "failing to meet club expectations on a number of occasions" in 2012.

2021 overhaul of the Carlton Football Club including the sacking of senior coach David Teague and chief executive officer Cain Liddle
a reprimand handed to Greater Western Sydney player Tom Green in the wake of comments he made criticizing Match Review Officer Michael Christian and the AFL Tribunal on a since-deleted club podcast.
the investigation into the Greater Western Sydney Giants' 2024 post-season function in which several players behaved inappropriately in a private setting, including the use of distasteful costumes and inappropriate skits. Captain Toby Greene was fined $5,000 for his lack of leadership, Josh Fahey was suspended for four matches, and five other players were suspended for two matches each for their roles in the scandal.

Expansion
The AFL Commission has a role in undertaking assessments of expansion clubs and awarding new licences including:

Gold Coast Suns
Greater Western Sydney Giants
Tasmania (to commence play in 2028)
The Commission owns a stake in the Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney clubs.

Member club viability
The AFL Commission manages a special fund called the Competitive Balance Fund (CBF) since 2004 as a grant of up to $5 million per club to ensure that member clubs remain financially viable.
The system was later changed to the Annual Special Distribution (ASD) of $6.3 million shared among all clubs, as well as allowing for grants and special concessions, such as payments, to ensure that the AFL member clubs remain viable in the short term. In 2006, the Commission approved a $2.1 million special financial assistance package for Carlton.
In response to clubs increasingly relying on and applying for special funding, in 2008, the Commission recommended removing the fund altogether, but after considerable club protests led by three struggling clubs, the Western Bulldogs, Melbourne and North Melbourne, CEO Andrew Demetriou announced that the ASD would remain.
In early 2009, it increased Melbourne's assistance from $250,000 to $1 million and made a $1 million grant to Port Adelaide.
