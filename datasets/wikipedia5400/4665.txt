4665
Burundi
[Burundi](4665), officially the Republic of [Burundi](4665), is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley at the junction between the [Africa](1700)n Great Lakes region and Southeast [Africa](1700), with population of over 14 million people. It is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and southeast, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Lake Tanganyika lies along its southwestern border. The capital city is Gitega and the largest city is Bujumbura.
The Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in [Burundi](4665) for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, [Burundi](4665) was an independent kingdom. In 1885, it became part of the German colony of German East [Africa](1700). After the First World War and Germany's defeat, the League of Nations mandated the territories of [Burundi](4665) and neighboring Rwanda to [Belgium](197) in a combined territory called Rwanda-Urundi. After the Second World War, this transformed into a United Nations Trust Territory. [Burundi](4665) gained independence in 1962 and initially retained the monarchy; a 1966 coup replaced the monarchy with a one-party republic. Over the next 27 years, [Burundi](4665) was ruled by a series of Tutsi dictators and notably experienced a genocide of Hutus in 1972. In July 1993, Melchior Ndadaye became [Burundi](4665)'s first Hutu president following the country's first multi-party presidential election. His assassination three months later during a coup attempt provoked the 12-year [Burundi](4665)an Civil War. In 2000, the Arusha Agreement was adopted, which was largely integrated in a new constitution in 2005. Since the 2005 post-war elections, the country's dominant party has been the National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD–FDD), widely accused of authoritarian governance and perpetuating the country's poor human rights record.
[Burundi](4665) remains primarily a rural society, with just 13.4% of the population living in urban areas in 2019. [Burundi](4665) is densely populated, and many young people emigrate in search of opportunities elsewhere. Roughly 85% of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin, 15% are Tutsi, and fewer than 1% are Twa. The official languages of [Burundi](4665) are Kirundi, French, and English—Kirundi being officially recognised as the sole national language. English was made an official language in 2014.
One of the smallest countries in [Africa](1700), [Burundi](4665)'s land is used mostly for subsistence agriculture and grazing. Deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat loss are major ecological concerns. As of 2005, the country was almost completely deforested. Less than 6% of its land was covered by trees, and over half of that being for commercial plantations. [Burundi](4665) is the poorest country in the world by nominal GDP per capita, and is one of the least developed countries. It faces widespread poverty, corruption, instability, authoritarianism, and illiteracy. The 2018 World Happiness Report ranked the country as the world's least happy with a rank of 156. [Burundi](4665) is a member of the [Africa](1700)n Union, Common Market for Eastern and Southern [Africa](1700), United Nations, East [Africa](1700)n Community (EAC), OIF and the Non-Aligned Movement.

Etymology
Modern [Burundi](4665) is named after the King of Urundi, who ruled the region starting in the 16th century. It derives its name from a word "Urundi" in Kirundi the local language, which means "Another one". Later the Belgian mandate to Ruanda-Urundi region came to rename it and their former capital "Usumbura" of both kingdoms by adding the letter "B" in front of it.

History
[Burundi](4665) is one of the few countries in [Africa](1700), along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as [Botswana](4492), Lesotho, and Eswatini), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era [Africa](1700)n state. The early history of [Burundi](4665), and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups, the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.

Kingdom of [Burundi](4665)
The first evidence of the [Burundi](4665)an state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours.
The Kingdom of [Burundi](4665), or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common. The king, known as the mwami (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (ganwa) which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi). The Kingdom of [Burundi](4665) was characterised by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.
In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru. They had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima. In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity, however. Some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.
The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the Ganwa. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one. There were also many reports of marriages between Hutu and Tutsi people. In general, regional ties and power struggles played a far more determining role in [Burundi](4665)'s politics than ethnicity.

Rule by Germany and [Belgium](197)
From 1884, the German East [Africa](1700) Company was active in the [Africa](1700)n Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the German East [Africa](1700) Company, the [British Empire](2056) and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the German Empire was called upon to put down the Abushiri revolts and protect the empire's interests in the region. The German East [Africa](1700) Company transferred its rights to the German Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the German colony of German East [Africa](1700), which included [Burundi](4665) (Urundi), Rwanda (Ruanda), and the mainland part of Tanzania (formerly known as Tanganyika). The German Empire stationed armed forces in Rwanda and [Burundi](4665) during the late 1880s. The location of the present-day city of Gitega served as an administrative centre for the Ruanda-Urundi region.
During the First World War, the East [Africa](1700)n Campaign greatly affected the [Africa](1700)n Great Lakes region. The Belgian and British colonial forces of the allied powers launched a coordinated attack on the German colony. The German army stationed in [Burundi](4665) was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, [Burundi](4665) and Rwanda were occupied. The Force Publique and the British Lake Force then started a thrust to capture Tabora, an administrative centre of central German East [Africa](1700). After the war, as outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former German East [Africa](1700) to [Belgium](197).
On 20 October 1924, Ruanda-Urundi, which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and [Burundi](4665), became a Belgian League of Nations mandate territory, with Usumbura as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the Belgian colonial empire. [Burundi](4665), as part of Ruanda-Urundi, continued its kingship dynasty despite the presence of European authorities.
The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions; the [Burundi](4665)an monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period. Following the Second World War, Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a United Nations Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority. During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of [Burundi](4665)'s government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers. In 1948, [Belgium](197) allowed the region to form political parties. These factions contributed to [Burundi](4665) gaining its independence from [Belgium](197), on 1 July 1962.

Independence
On 20 January 1959, King Mwami Mwambutsa IV requested [Burundi](4665)'s independence from [Belgium](197) and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union. In the following months, [Burundi](4665)an political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and [Burundi](4665). The first and largest of these political parties was the Union for National Progress (UPRONA).
[Burundi](4665)'s push for independence was influenced by the Rwandan Revolution and the accompanying instability and ethnic conflict that occurred there. As a result of the Rwandan Revolution, many Rwandan Tutsi refugees arrived in [Burundi](4665) from 1959 to 1961.
[Burundi](4665)'s first elections took place on 8 September 1961 and UPRONA, a multi-ethnic unity party led by Prince Louis Rwagasore won just over 80% of the electorate's votes. In the wake of the elections, on 13 October, the 29-year-old Prince Rwagasore was assassinated, robbing [Burundi](4665) of its most popular and well-known nationalist.
The country claimed independence on 1 July 1962, and legally changed its name from Ruanda-Urundi to [Burundi](4665). [Burundi](4665) became a constitutional monarchy with Mwami Mwambutsa IV, Prince Rwagasore's father, serving as the country's king. On 18 September 1962 [Burundi](4665) joined the United Nations.
In 1963, King Mwambutsa appointed a Hutu prime minister, Pierre Ngendandumwe, but he was assassinated on 15 January 1965 by a Rwandan Tutsi employed by the US Embassy. The assassination occurred in the broader context of the Congo Crisis during which Western anti-communist countries were confronting the communist People's Republic of China as it attempted to make [Burundi](4665) a logistics base for communist insurgents battling in Congo. Parliamentary elections in May 1965 brought a majority of Hutu into the parliament, but when King Mwambutsa appointed a Tutsi prime minister, some Hutu felt this was unjust and ethnic tensions were further increased. In October 1965, an attempted coup d'état led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed. The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain Michel Micombero purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a precursor to the 1972 [Burundi](4665)an Genocide.
King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a coup in July 1966 and his teenage son, Prince Ntare V, claimed the throne. In November that same year, the Tutsi Prime Minister, then-Captain Michel Micombero, carried out another coup, this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a republic, though his one-party government was effectively a military dictatorship. As president, Micombero became an advocate of [Africa](1700)n socialism and received support from the People's Republic of China. He imposed a staunch regime of law and order and sharply repressed Hutu militarism.

Civil war and genocides
In late April 1972, two events led to the outbreak of the First [Burundi](4665)an Genocide. On 27 April 1972, a rebellion led by Hutu members of the gendarmerie broke out in the lakeside towns of Rumonge and Nyanza-Lac and the rebels declared the short-lived Martyazo Republic. The rebels attacked both Tutsi and any Hutu who refused to join their rebellion. During this initial Hutu outbreak, anywhere from 800 to 1200 people were killed. At the same time, King Ntare V of [Burundi](4665) returned from exile, heightening political tension in the country. On 29 April 1972, the 24-year-old Ntare V was murdered. In subsequent months, the Tutsi-dominated government of Michel Micombero used the army to combat Hutu rebels and commit genocide, murdering targeted members of the Hutu majority. The total number of casualties was never established, but contemporary estimates put the number of people killed between 80,000 and 210,000. In addition, several hundred thousand Hutu were estimated to have fled the killings into Zaïre, Rwanda and Tanzania.
Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, a Tutsi, led a bloodless coup to topple Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained [Burundi](4665)'s status as a one-party state. In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.
Major Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, overthrew Bagaza in 1987, suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to killings of Tutsi peasants in the northern communes of Ntega and Marangara in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000, some international NGOs believed this understated the deaths.
The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an amnesty for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the "culture of impunity." Other analysts put the origins of the "culture of impunity" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.
In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to Pierre Buyoya, asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed Adrien Sibomana (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity. In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system, but a civil war broke out.
An estimated total of 250,000 people died in [Burundi](4665) from the various conflicts between 1962 and 1993.
Since [Burundi](4665)'s independence in 1962, two genocides have taken place in the country: the 1972 mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army, and the mass killings of Tutsis in 1993 by the Hutu majority. Both were described as genocides in the final report of the International Commission of Inquiry for [Burundi](4665) presented in 2002 to the United Nations Security Council.

First attempt at democracy and war between Tutsi National Army and Hutu population
In June 1993, Melchior Ndadaye, leader of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in [Burundi](4665) (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. Though he attempted to smooth the country's bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. The ensuing [Burundi](4665)an Civil War (1993–2005) saw persistent violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.
In early 1994, the parliament elected Cyprien Ntaryamira (Hutu) to the office of president. He and Juvénal Habyarimana, the president of Rwanda, both Hutus, died together when their airplane was shot down in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in Bujumbura, the then-capital, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.
In 1996, Pierre Buyoya (Tutsi) again took power through a coup d'état. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. This was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to refugee camps. Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by South [Africa](1700). Both parties signed agreements in Arusha, Tanzania and Pretoria, South [Africa](1700), to share power in [Burundi](4665). The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for [Burundi](4665) was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled [Burundi](4665)an government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).
In 2003, FRODEBU leader Domitien Ndayizeye (Hutu) was elected president. In early 2005, ethnic quotas were formed for determining positions in [Burundi](4665)'s government. Throughout the year, elections for parliament and president occurred.
Pierre Nkurunziza (Hutu), once a leader of a rebel group, was elected president in 2005. As of 2008, the [Burundi](4665)an government was talking with the Hutu-led Palipehutu-National Liberation Forces (NLF) to bring peace to the country.

Peace agreements
[Africa](1700)n leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere in 1995; following his death, South [Africa](1700)n President Nelson Mandela took the helm. As the talks progressed, South [Africa](1700)n President Thabo Mbeki and United States President Bill Clinton also lent their respective weight.
The peace talks took the form of Track I mediations. This method of negotiation can be defined as a form of diplomacy involving governmental or intergovernmental representatives, who may use their positive reputations, mediation, or the "carrot and stick" method as a means of obtaining or forcing an outcome, frequently along the lines of "bargaining" or "win-lose".
The main objective was to transform the [Burundi](4665)an government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.
As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the [Burundi](4665)an officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the [Burundi](4665)ans believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.
In 2000, the [Burundi](4665)an President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of [Africa](1700)n leaders in Tanzania, the [Burundi](4665)an president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.

UN involvement
Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South [Africa](1700) and Uganda, gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South [Africa](1700)n Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect [Burundi](4665)an leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [Africa](1700)n Union Mission to [Burundi](4665), deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in [Burundi](4665).
The mission's mandate, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, has been to monitor cease-fire, carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former military personnel, support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return, assist with elections, protect international staff and [Burundi](4665)an civilians, monitor [Burundi](4665)'s troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows, and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.
The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing: no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.
The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the constitution was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.
While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large. It was involved with several "quick effect" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.
The  2005 Constitution formalised a complex power-sharing architecture that has been described as "associational" in its logic, as it aims to provide guarantees of representation for the Tutsi minority without entrenching the ethnic cleavage at the centre of [Burundi](4665)an politics. This institutional design provides an original contribution from [Burundi](4665)an negotiators and constitution makers to institutional options to manage ethnic conflict.

2006 to 2018
Reconstruction efforts in [Burundi](4665) started to practically take effect after 2006. The UN shut down its peacekeeping mission and re-focused on helping with reconstruction. Toward achieving economic reconstruction, Rwanda, D.R.Congo and [Burundi](4665) relaunched the regional Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries. In addition, [Burundi](4665), along with Rwanda, joined the East [Africa](1700)n Community in 2007.
However, the terms of the September 2006 Ceasefire between the government and the last remaining armed opposition group, the FLN (Forces for National Liberation, also called NLF or FROLINA), were not totally implemented, and senior FLN members subsequently left the truce monitoring team, claiming that their security was threatened. In September 2007, rival FLN factions clashed in the capital, killing 20 fighters and causing residents to begin fleeing. Rebel raids were reported in other parts of the country. The rebel factions disagreed with the government over disarmament and the release of political prisoners. In late 2007 and early 2008, FLN combatants attacked government-protected camps where former combatants were living. The homes of rural residents were also pillaged.
The 2007 report of [Amnesty International](4628) mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity continued to go unpunished.
In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity . Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.
On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The [Burundi](4665)an army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader Agathon Rwasa, with the mediation of Charles Nqakula, South [Africa](1700)'s Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.
The UN has attempted to evaluate the impact of its peace-building initiatives. In the early 2010s, the UN peacekeeping mission in [Burundi](4665) sought to assess the success of its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program by counting the number of arms that had been collected, given the prevalence of arms in the country. However, these evaluations failed to include data from local populations, which are significant in impact evaluations of peacebuilding initiatives.
As of 2012, [Burundi](4665) was participating in [Africa](1700)n Union peacekeeping missions, including the mission to Somalia against Al-Shabaab militants. In 2014, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established, initially for four years and then extended for another four in 2018.

2015 unrest
In April 2015 protests broke out after the ruling party announced President Pierre Nkurunziza would seek a third term in office. Protestors claimed Nkurunziza could not run for a third term in office but the country's constitutional court agreed with Nkurunziza (although some of its members had fled the country at the time of its vote).
An attempted coup d'état on 13 May failed to depose Nkurunziza.

 He returned to [Burundi](4665), began purging his government, and arrested several of the coup leaders. Following the attempted coup, protests however continued and over 100,000 people had fled the country by 20 May causing a humanitarian emergency. There are reports of continued and widespread abuses of human rights, including unlawful killings, torture, disappearances, and restrictions on freedom of expression.
Despite calls by the United Nations, the [Africa](1700)n Union, the United States, France, South [Africa](1700), [Belgium](197), and various other governments to refrain, the ruling party held parliamentary elections on 29 June, but these were boycotted by the opposition.
On 30 September 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry on [Burundi](4665) through resolution 33/24. Its mandate is to "conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses committed in [Burundi](4665) since April 2015, to identify alleged perpetrators and to formulate recommendations." On 29 September 2017 the Commission of Inquiry on [Burundi](4665) called on [Burundi](4665)an government to put an end to serious human rights violations. It further stressed that, "The [Burundi](4665)an government has so far refused to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry, despite the Commission's repeated requests and initiatives." The violations the Commission documented include arbitrary arrests and detentions, acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, rape and other forms of sexual violence."

2018 to present
In a constitutional referendum in May 2018, [Burundi](4665)ans voted by 79.08% to approve an amended constitution that ensured that Nkurunziza could remain in power until 2034. However, much to the surprise of most observers, Nkurunziza later announced that he did not intend to serve another term, paving the way for a new president to be elected in the 2020 general election.
On 20 May 2020, Evariste Ndayishimiye, a candidate who was hand-picked as Nkurunziza's successor by the CNDD-FDD, won the election with 71.45% of the vote. Shortly after, on 9 June 2020, Nkurunziza died of a cardiac arrest, at the age of 55. There was some speculation that his death was COVID-19 related, though this is unconfirmed. As per the constitution, Pascal Nyabenda, the president of the national assembly, led the government until Ndayishimiye's inauguration on 18 June 2020.
In December 2021, a large prison fire killed dozens in the capital city of Gitega.
In November 2022, in challenges to the [COVID-19 pandemic](3556) and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [Burundi](4665)'s economic growth increased slightly to 3 percent, according to an assessment of the International Monetary Fund.
Currently, [Burundi](4665) remains as one of the poorest nations on Earth based on a Gross National Income (GNI) of $270 per capita.

Government
[Burundi](4665)'s political system is that of a presidential representative democratic republic based upon a multi-party state. The president of [Burundi](4665) is the head of state and head of government. There are currently 21 registered parties in [Burundi](4665). On 13 March 1992, Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution, which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition. Six years later, on 6 June 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening National Assembly's seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents. Because of the Arusha Accord, [Burundi](4665) enacted a transitional government in 2000.
[Burundi](4665)'s legislative branch is a bicameral assembly, consisting of the Transitional National Assembly and the Transitional Senate. As of 2004, the Transitional National Assembly consisted of 170 members, with the Front for Democracy in [Burundi](4665) holding 38% of seats, and 10% of the assembly controlled by UPRONA. Fifty-two seats were controlled by other parties. [Burundi](4665)'s constitution mandates representation in the Transitional National Assembly to be consistent with 60% Hutu, 40% Tutsi, and 30% female members, as well as three Batwa members. Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote and serve five-year terms.
The Transitional Senate has fifty-one members, and three seats are reserved for former presidents. Due to stipulations in [Burundi](4665)'s constitution, 30% of Senate members must be female. Members of the Senate are elected by electoral colleges, which consist of members from each of [Burundi](4665)'s provinces and communes. For each of [Burundi](4665)'s eighteen provinces, one Hutu and one Tutsi senator are chosen. One term for the Transitional Senate is five years.
Together, [Burundi](4665)'s legislative branch elect the president to a five-year term. [Burundi](4665)'s president appoints officials to his Council of Ministers, which is also part of the executive branch. The president can also pick fourteen members of the Transitional Senate to serve on the Council of Ministers. Members of the Council of Ministers must be approved by two-thirds of [Burundi](4665)'s legislature. The president also chooses two vice-presidents. Following the 2015 election, the president of [Burundi](4665) was Pierre Nkurunziza. The first vice-president was Therence Sinunguruza, and the Second Vice-president was Gervais Rufyikiri.
On 20 May 2020, Evariste Ndayishimiye, a candidate who was hand-picked as Nkurunziza's successor by the CNDD-FDD, won the election with 71.45% of the vote. Shortly after, on 9 June 2020, Nkurunziza died of a cardiac arrest, at the age of 55. As per the constitution, Pascal Nyabenda, the president of the national assembly, led the government until Ndayishimiye's inauguration on 18 June 2020.
The Cour Suprême (Supreme Court) is [Burundi](4665)'s highest court. There are three Courts of Appeals directly below the Supreme Court. Tribunals of First Instance are used as judicial courts in each of [Burundi](4665)'s provinces as well as 123 local tribunals.

Human rights
[Burundi](4665)'s government has been repeatedly criticised by human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch for the multiple arrests and trials of journalist Jean-Claude Kavumbagu for issues related to his reporting. [Amnesty International](4628) (AI) named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his "immediate and unconditional release."
In April 2009, the government of [Burundi](4665) changed the law to criminalise homosexuality. Persons found guilty of consensual same-sex relations risk three months to two years in prison and/or a fine of 50,000 to 100,000 [Burundi](4665)an francs. [Amnesty International](4628) has condemned the action, calling it a violation of [Burundi](4665)'s obligations under international and regional human rights law, and against the constitution, which guarantees the right to privacy.
[Burundi](4665) officially left the International Criminal Court (ICC) on 27 October 2017, the first country in the world to do so. The move came after the UN accused the country of various crimes and human rights violations, such as extrajudicial killings, torture and sexual violence, in a September 2017 report. The ICC announced on 9 November 2017 that human rights violations from the time [Burundi](4665) was a member would still be prosecuted.

Administrative divisions
[Burundi](4665) is divided into 18 provinces, 119 communes, and 2,638 collines (hills). Provincial governments are structured upon these boundaries.
[Burundi](4665)'s provinces and communes were created on Christmas Day in 1959 by a Belgian colonial decree. They replaced the pre-existing system of chieftains.
In 2000, the province encompassing Bujumbura was separated into two provinces, Bujumbura Rural and Bujumbura Mairie. The newest province, Rumonge, was created on 26 March 2015 from portions of Bujumbura Rural and Bururi.
In July 2022, the government of [Burundi](4665) announced a complete overhaul of the country's territorial subdivisions. The proposed change would reduce the amounts of provinces from 18 to 5, and reduce the amount of communes from 119 to 42. The change needs the approval of the parliament of [Burundi](4665) to take effect.

Geography
One of the smallest countries in [Africa](1700), [Burundi](4665) is landlocked and has an equatorial climate. [Burundi](4665) is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western extension of the East [Africa](1700)n Rift. The country lies on a rolling plateau in the centre of [Africa](1700). [Burundi](4665) is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and southeast, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It lies within the Albertine Rift montane forests, Central Zambezian miombo woodlands, and Victoria Basin forest-savanna mosaic ecoregions.
The average elevation of the central plateau is 1,707 m (5,600 ft), with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, Mount Heha at 2,685 m (8,810 ft), lies to the southeast of the largest city and economic capital, Bujumbura. The source of the Nile River is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River. Lake Victoria is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the Kagera River. Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika, located in much of [Burundi](4665)'s southwestern corner.
In [Burundi](4665) forest cover is around 11% of the total land area, equivalent to 279,640 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 276,480 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 166,670 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 112,970 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 23% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 41% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.
There are two national parks: Kibira National Park to the northwest (a small region of rainforest, adjacent to Nyungwe Forest National Park in Rwanda), and Ruvubu National Park to the northeast (along the Rurubu River, also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu). Both were established in 1982 to conserve wildlife populations.

Economy
[Burundi](4665) is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly agricultural, accounting for 50% of GDP in 2017 and employing more than 90% of the population. Subsistence agriculture accounts for 90% of agriculture. [Burundi](4665)'s primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Other agricultural products include cotton, tea, maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes, bananas, manioc (tapioca); beef, milk and hides. Even though subsistence farming is highly relied upon, many people do not have the resources to sustain themselves. This is due to large population growth and no coherent policies governing land ownership. In 2014, the average farm size was about one acre.
[Burundi](4665) is the world's poorest country, owing in part to its landlocked geography, lack of access to education and the proliferation of HIV/AIDS. Approximately 80% of [Burundi](4665)'s population lives in poverty. Famines and food shortages have occurred throughout [Burundi](4665), most notably in the 20th century, and according to the World Food Programme, 56.8% of children under age five suffer from chronic malnutrition. [Burundi](4665)'s export earnings – and its ability to pay for imports – rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices.
The purchasing power of most [Burundi](4665)ans has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. As a result of deepening poverty, [Burundi](4665) will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Foreign aid represents 42% of [Burundi](4665)'s national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan [Africa](1700). [Burundi](4665) joined the East [Africa](1700)n Community in 2009, which should boost its regional trade ties, and also in 2009 received $700 million in debt relief. Government corruption is hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules.
Studies since 2007 have shown [Burundi](4665)ans to have extremely poor levels of satisfaction with life; the World Happiness Report 2018 rated them the world's least happy.

Some of [Burundi](4665)'s natural resources include uranium, nickel, cobalt, copper and platinum. Besides agriculture, other industries include: the assembly of imported components; public works construction; food processing, and light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, and soap.
In regards to telecommunications infrastructure, [Burundi](4665) is ranked second to last in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. [Burundi](4665) ranked number 147 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 144 in 2013.
Lack of access to financial services is a serious problem for the majority of the population, particularly in densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of [Burundi](4665)ans being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits, and short- to medium-term credit. The dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.
[Burundi](4665) is part of the East [Africa](1700)n Community and a potential member of the planned East [Africa](1700)n Federation. [Burundi](4665) economy has declined since 1990s and [Burundi](4665) is behind all neighbouring countries.
[Burundi](4665) was ranked 127th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

Currency
[Burundi](4665)'s currency is the [Burundi](4665)an franc. It is nominally subdivided into 100 centimes, though coins have never been issued in centimes in independent [Burundi](4665); centime coins were circulated only when [Burundi](4665) used the Belgian Congo franc.
Monetary policy is controlled by the central bank, Bank of the Republic of [Burundi](4665).

Transport
[Burundi](4665)'s transport network is limited and underdeveloped. According to a 2012 DHL Global Connectedness Index, [Burundi](4665) is the least globalised of 140 surveyed countries. Bujumbura International Airport is the only airport with a paved runway and as of May 2017 it was serviced by four airlines (Brussels Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenya Airways and RwandAir). Kigali is the city with the most daily flight connections to Bujumbura. The country has a road network but as of 2005 less than 10% of the country's roads were paved and as of 2012 private bus companies were the main operators of buses on the international route to Kigali; however, there were no bus connections to the other neighbouring countries (Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo). Bujumbura is connected by a passenger and cargo ferry (the MV Mwongozo) to Kigoma in Tanzania. There is a long-term plan to link the country via rail to Kigali and then onward to Kampala and Kenya.

Demographics
As of October 2021, [Burundi](4665) was estimated by the United Nations to have a population of 12,346,893, compared to only 2,456,000 in 1950. The population growth rate is 2.5 percent per year, more than double the average global pace, and a [Burundi](4665)an woman has on average 5.10 children, more than double the international fertility rate. [Burundi](4665) had the tenth highest total fertility rate in the world, just behind Somalia, in 2021.
Many [Burundi](4665)ans have migrated to other countries as a result of the civil war. In 2006, the United States accepted approximately 10,000 [Burundi](4665)an refugees.
[Burundi](4665) remains an overwhelmingly rural society, with just 13% of the population living in urban areas in 2013. The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre (753 per sq mi) is the second highest in Sub-Saharan [Africa](1700). Roughly 85% of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin, 15% are Tutsi and fewer than 1% are indigenous Twa.

Languages
The official languages of [Burundi](4665) are Kirundi, French, and English. English was made an official language in 2014. Virtually the entire population speaks Kirundi, and just under 10% speak French.

Religion
Sources estimate the Christian population at 80–90%, with Roman Catholics representing the largest group at 60–65%. Protestant and Anglican practitioners constitute the remaining 15–25%. An estimated 5% of the population adheres to traditional indigenous religious beliefs. Muslims constitute 2–5%, the majority of whom are Sunnis and live in urban areas.

Health
[Burundi](4665) has the worst hunger and malnourishment rates of all 120 countries ranked in the Global Hunger Index. The civil war in 1962 put a stop on the medical advancements in the country. [Burundi](4665), again, went into a violent cycle in 2015, jeopardising the citizens of [Burundi](4665)'s medical care. Like other countries in Sub-Saharan [Africa](1700), [Burundi](4665) uses indigenous medicine in addition to biomedicine. In the 1980s, [Burundi](4665)'s health authorities asked the United Nations Development Program for support to develop quality control for and begin new research on pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants. At the same time, the [Burundi](4665) Association of Traditional Practitioners (ATRADIBU) was founded, which teamed up with the governments agency to set up the Centre for Research and Promotion of Traditional Medicine in [Burundi](4665) (CRPMT). The recent influx of international aid has supported the work of biomedical health systems in [Burundi](4665). However, international aid workers have traditionally stayed away from indigenous medicine in [Burundi](4665). As of 2015, roughly 1 out of 10 children in [Burundi](4665) die before the age of 5 from preventable and treatable illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. The current violence in [Burundi](4665) has limited the country's access to medication and hospital equipment. The life expectancy in [Burundi](4665), as of 2015, was 60.1 years. In 2013, [Burundi](4665) spent 8% of their GDP on healthcare. While [Burundi](4665)'s fertility rate is 6.1 children per women, the country's infant death rate is 61.9 deaths for every 1,000 live births. Common diseases in [Burundi](4665) include malaria and typhoid fever.

Culture
[Burundi](4665)'s culture is based on local tradition and the influence of neighbouring countries, though cultural prominence has been hindered by civil unrest. Since farming is the main industry, a typical [Burundi](4665)an meal consists of sweet potatoes, corn, rice and peas. Due to the expense, meat is eaten only a few times per month.
When several [Burundi](4665)ans of close acquaintance meet for a gathering they drink impeke, a beer, together from a large container to symbolise unity.
Notable [Burundi](4665)ans include the footballer Mohamed Tchité and singer Jean-Pierre Nimbona, popularly known as Kidumu (who is based in Nairobi, Kenya).
Crafts are an important art form in [Burundi](4665) and are attractive gifts to many tourists. Basket weaving is a popular craft for local artisans, as well as other crafts such as masks, shields, statues and pottery.
Drumming is an important part of the cultural heritage. The world-famous Royal Drummers of [Burundi](4665), who have performed for over 40 years, are noted for traditional drumming using the karyenda, amashako, ibishikiso and ikiranya drums. Dance often accompanies drumming performance, which is frequently seen in celebrations and family gatherings. The abatimbo, which is performed at official ceremonies and rituals and the fast-paced abanyagasimbo are some famous [Burundi](4665)an dances. Some musical instruments of note are the flute, zither, ikembe, indonongo, umuduri, inanga and the inyagara.

The country's oral tradition is strong, relaying history and life lessons through storytelling, poetry and song. Imigani, indirimbo, amazina and ivyivugo are literary genres in [Burundi](4665).
Basketball and track and field are noted sports. Martial arts are popular, as well. There are five major judo clubs: Club Judo de l'Entente Sportive, in Downtown, and four others throughout the city. [Association football](2100) is a popular pastime throughout the country, as are mancala games.
Most Christian holidays are celebrated, with Christmas being the largest. [Burundi](4665)an Independence Day is celebrated annually on 1 July. In 2005, the [Burundi](4665)an government declared Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic holiday, to be a public holiday.

Media
Education
In 2012, the adult literacy rate in [Burundi](4665) was estimated to be 74.71% for men and women between the ages of 15 and 24, while the youth literacy rate was much higher at 92.58%. [Burundi](4665) has a comparatively high literacy rate to other countries in the region, which is only about 10% lower than the global average. Ten percent of [Burundi](4665)an boys are allowed a secondary education.
[Burundi](4665) has one public university, University of [Burundi](4665). There are museums in the cities, such as the [Burundi](4665) Geological Museum in Bujumbura and the [Burundi](4665) National Museum and the [Burundi](4665) Museum of Life in Gitega.
In 2010 a new elementary school was opened in the small village of Rwoga that is funded by the pupils of Westwood High School, Quebec, [Canada](1956).
As of 2022, [Burundi](4665) invested the equivalent of 5% of its GDP in education.

Science and technology
[Burundi](4665)'s Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, Research and Innovation (2013) covers the following areas: food technology; medical sciences; energy, mining and transportation; water; desertification; environmental biotechnology and indigenous knowledge; materials science; engineering and industry; ICTs; space sciences; mathematical sciences; and social and human sciences.
With regard to material sciences, [Burundi](4665)'s publication intensity doubled from 0.6 to 1.2 articles per million inhabitants between 2012 and 2019, placing it in the top 15 for sub-Saharan [Africa](1700) for this strategic technology.
Medical sciences remain the main focus of research: medical researchers accounted for 4% of the country's scientists in 2018 but 41% of scientific publications between 2011 and 2019.
The focus of the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, Research and Innovation (2013) has been on developing an institutional framework and infrastructure, fostering greater regional and international co-operation and placing science in society. In October 2014, the EAC Secretariat designated the National Institute of Public Health a centre of excellence. Data are unavailable on output on nutritional sciences, the institute's area of specialization, but between 2011 and 2019, [Burundi](4665) scientists produced seven articles on each of HIV and tropical communicable diseases and a further five on tuberculosis, all focus areas for the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Strategic Plan has also focused on training researchers. Researcher density (in head counts) grew from 40 to 55 researchers per million inhabitants between 2011 and 2018. The amount of funding available to each researcher more than doubled from PPP$14,310 (constant 2005 values) to PPP$22,480, since the domestic research effort has also risen since 2012, from 0.11% to 0.21% of GDP.
[Burundi](4665) has almost tripled its scientific output since 2011 but the pace has not picked up since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. With six scientific publications per million inhabitants, [Burundi](4665) still has one of the lowest publication rate in Central and East [Africa](1700). Some 97.5% of publications involved foreign co-authorship between 2017 and 2019, with Ugandans figuring among the top five partners.
