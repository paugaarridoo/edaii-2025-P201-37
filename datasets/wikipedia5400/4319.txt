History
The Panamanian Academy of the Spanish Language was established on May 12, 1926, and officially founded on August 9, 1926. As a member of the [Association of Academies of the Spanish Language](4344), this institution is dedicated to promoting the dissemination of significant Panamanian publications and books. It is tasked with developing a lexicon of accepted Panamanianisms, including neologisms and archaisms, complete with citations and annotations. These are submitted to the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE) for potential inclusion in future editions of the Official Dictionary of the Language.
The founding of the academy was marked by the appointment of eighteen notable Panamanian intellectuals by the Royal Spanish Academy. These included Samuel Lewis García de Paredes as director, Eduardo Chiari as treasurer, and Ricardo Miró as perpetual secretary, along with other distinguished figures such as Ricardo J. Alfaro, Guillermo Andreve, and Belisario Porras.

Headquarters
The headquarters of the Panamanian Academy of Language is located in a large house with architecture from the first quarter of the twentieth century in the sector of Calle 50, in the district of Bella Vista, located in the urban and economic area of Panama City.

Functions
In Panama, the Academy of the Spanish Language conducts various activities including organizing conferences on linguistic, literary, and humanistic topics. The Director, along with one or two other academicians, represents the academy at the congresses organized periodically by the [Association of Academies of the Spanish Language](4344). This association, which comprises 22 member academies, holds meetings every six months where terms are presented and evaluated by a commission of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE) for potential inclusion in the official dictionary.
Arístides Royo, the current director of the Panamanian Academy of the Spanish Language, has outlined the institution's functions as follows:

The Academia Panameña de la Lengua wants to be an institution that all Panamanians consider as the house where the [Spanish language](4301) is preserved, cared for and strengthened. We want Panamanians to come to it to resolve any language doubts they may have, to enjoy the lectures that are given and the films based on fundamental works of world literature.

Arístides Royo, Director of the Panamanian Academy of Language.
