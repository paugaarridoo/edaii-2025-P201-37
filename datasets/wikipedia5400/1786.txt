Africanfuturism
[Africa](1700)nfuturism is a cultural aesthetic and philosophy of science that centers on the fusion of [Africa](1700)n culture, history, mythology, point of view, with technology based in [Africa](1700) and not limiting to the diaspora. It was coined by Nigerian American writer Nnedi Okorafor in 2019 in a blog post as a single word. Nnedi Okorafor  defines [Africa](1700)nfuturism as a sub-category of science fiction that is "directly rooted in [Africa](1700)n culture, history, mythology and point-of-view..and...does not privilege or center the West," is centered with optimistic "visions in the future," and is written by (and centered on) "people of [Africa](1700)n descent" while rooted in the [Africa](1700)n continent. As such its center is [Africa](1700)n, often does extend upon the continent of [Africa](1700), and includes the Black diaspora, including fantasy that is set in the future, making a narrative "more science fiction than fantasy" and typically has mystical elements. It is different from Afrofuturism, which focuses mainly on the [Africa](1700)n diaspora, particularly the United States. Works of [Africa](1700)nfuturism include science fiction, fantasy, alternate history, horror and magic realism.
Writers of [Africa](1700)nfuturism include Nnedi Okorafor, Tochi Onyebuchi, Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, Tade Thompson, Namwali Serpell, Wole Talabi, Suyi Davies Okungbowa.

History
Early beginnings
Works of [Africa](1700)nfuturism have long existed and have been assigned to Afrofuturism. Themes of [Africa](1700)nfuturism can be traced back to Buchi Emecheta's 1983 novel The Rape Of Shavi and Ben Okri's 1991 novel The Famished Road.

21st century
In 2019 and 2020, [Africa](1700)n writers began to reject the term Afrofuturism because of the differences between both genres with [Africa](1700)nfuturism focusing more on [Africa](1700)n point of view, culture, themes and history as opposed to Afrofuturism which covers [Africa](1700)n diaspora history, culture and themes. The speculative fiction magazine Omenana and the Nommo Awards presented by The [Africa](1700)n Speculative Fiction Society launched in 2017 helped to widen the content of the genre.
In August 2020, Hope Wabuke, a writer and assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln of English and Creative Writing, noted that Afrofuturism, coined by Mark Dery, a White critic, in 1993, treats [Africa](1700)n-American themes and concerns in the "context of twentieth-century technoculture," which was later expanded by Alondra Nelson, arguing that Dery's conception of Blackness began in 1619 and "is marked solely by the ensuing 400 years of violation by whiteness" that he portrayed as "potentially irreparable." Critical of this definition, saying it lacks the qualities of the "Black American diasporic imagination" and ability to conceive of "Blackness outside of the Black American diaspora" or independent from Whiteness, she noted that "[Africa](1700)nfuturism" is different because it is, according to Nnedi Okorafor, more deeply rooted in "[Africa](1700)n culture, history, mythology and point-of-view as it then branches into the Black diaspora, and it does not privilege or center the West," while explaining [Africa](1700)njujuism as a subcategory of fantasy. Wabuke further explains how [Africa](1700)nfuturism is more specific and rids itself of the "othering of the white gaze and the de facto colonial Western mindset," free from what she calls the "white Western gaze" and saying this is the main difference "between Afrofuturism and [Africa](1700)nfuturism." She adds that, in her view, [Africa](1700)nfuturism has a different outlook and perspective than "mainstream Western and American science fiction and fantasy" and even Afrofuturism which is "married to the white Western gaze." Wabuke goes on to explain [Africa](1700)nfuturist and [Africa](1700)njujuist themes in Okorafor's Who Fears Death and Zahrah the Windseeker, Akwaeke Emezi's Pet, and Buchi Emecheta's The Rape of Shavi.
In February 2021, Aigner Loren Wilson of Tor.com explained the difficulty of finding books in the subgenre because many institutions "treat [Africa](1700)nfuturism and Afrofuturism like the same thing" even though the distinction between them is plain. She said that [Africa](1700)nfuturism is "centered in and about [Africa](1700) and their people" while Afrofuturism is a sci-fi subcategory which is about "Black people within the diaspora," often including stories of those outside [Africa](1700), including in "colonized Western societies.". Another reviewer called Okorafor's Lagoon, which "recounts the story of the arrival of aliens in Nigeria," as an [Africa](1700)nfuturist work which requires a reader who is "actively engaged in co-creating the alternative future that the novel is constructing," meaning that the reader becomes part of the "creative conversation."

Literature and comics
[Africa](1700)nfuturism literature features speculative fiction which narrates events centered on [Africa](1700) from an [Africa](1700)n point of view rather than a Western point of view. Works of [Africa](1700)nfuturism literature are still wrongly categorized as Afrofuturism.
Works of Nigerian American writer Nnedi Okorafor are often in the [Africa](1700)nfuturism genre with her works like Who Fears Death, Lagoon, Remote Control, The Book of Phoenix and Noor. She won a Hugo and Nebula award for her novella Binti, the first from the Binti trilogy which features a native Himba girl from Namibia in space. Tade Thompson won a Arthur C. Clarke award for his [Africa](1700)nfuturist novel Rosewater about an alien dome in Nigeria and Zambian writer Namwali Serpell's The Old Drift won the same award.
In 2020, [Africa](1700)nfuturism: An Anthology edited by Wole Talabi was published by Brittle Paper and as of the end of 2022 is currently still offered for free on its website in celebration of the 10th anniversary of this publisher which has been called "the village square of [Africa](1700)n literature". Gary K. Wolfe reviewed this anthology in February 2021.  He credits Nnedi Okorafor for coining "[Africa](1700)nfuturism," noting its describes "more [Africa](1700)-centered SF," although saying he is not sure whether her term "[Africa](1700)njujuism," a parallel term for fantasy, will catch on. While saying that both are useful, he says that he does not like how they have to "do with the root, not the prefix," with "futurism" only describing a bit of science fiction and fantasy. He still calls the book a "solid anthology," saying it challenges the idea of viewing [Africa](1700)n science fiction as monolithic. Stories in the book include "Egoli" by T. L. Huchu, "Yat Madit" by Dilman Dila, "Behind Our Irises" by Tlotlo Tsamaase, "Fort Kwame" by Derek Lubangakene, "Rainmaker" by Mazi Nwonwu, "Fruit of the Calabash" by Rafeeat Aliyu, "Lekki Lekki" by Mame Bougouma Diene, and "Sunrise" by Nnedi Okorafor.
When Tor.com outlined a list of stories and books from the genre as of 2021, Tor also highlighted [Africa](1700)nfuturism: An Anthology (edited by Wole Talabi) along with the individual works of Namwali Serpell's The Old Drift, Nnedi Okorafor's Lagoon, Nicky Drayden's The Prey of Gods, Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki's Ife-Iyoku, the Tale of Imadeyunuagbon, and Tochi Onyebuchi's War Girls.
In comics, as of the end of 2022, so far a few [Africa](1700)nfuturism comics exist. Comic Republic Global Network, a Lagos-based publisher, is prominent in creating [Africa](1700)nfuturist superheroes like Guardian Prime. Laguardia, a comic book by Nnedi Okorafor, is associated with [Africa](1700)nfuturism.

Films and television
[Africa](1700)nfuturism movies are often scarce; films like Black Panther have been criticized by some viewers, who say that their depiction of [Africa](1700) "differs little from the colonial view". In recent times, [Africa](1700)nfuturist movies include Hello, Rain, Pumzi, and Ratnik. Several [Africa](1700)nfuturism novels have been optioned for live adaptation, including Binti and Who Fears Death. In 2020, Walt Disney Studios and Pan [Africa](1700)n company Kugali announced that they would be co-producing an africanfuturist animated science fiction series, Iwájú, inspired by the city of Lagos.
On July 5, 2023, Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire, an [Africa](1700)nfuturist animated anthology short film series premiered on Disney+, Peter Ramsey was picked as executive producer, while Tendayi Nyeke and Anthony Silverston were supervising producers, and Triggerfish was the primary studio, along with other animation studios in [Africa](1700). Each of the ten films is from an [Africa](1700)n perspective, on themes such as social media, duality, disability, self-reflection, shared humanity, and other topics, with stories which include time travel, extraterrestrials, and alternate universes.
