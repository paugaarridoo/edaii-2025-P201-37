British Ice Skating
British Ice Skating (formerly the National Ice Skating Association) is the national governing body of ice skating within the United Kingdom. Formed in 1879, it is responsible for overseeing all disciplines of ice skating: figure skating (singles, pairs and ice dance); synchronised skating; and speed skating (including short track).

History
On Saturday 1 February 1879 a number of prominent men of [Cambridge](2213)shire and Huntingdonshire met in the Guildhall, [Cambridge](2213), to set up the National Skating Association with the aim of regulating the sport of fen skating. A [Cambridge](2213) journalist, James Drake Digby, had thought that the Fen speed skaters were worthy of national recognition and he was also concerned that betting was leading to malpractice. He thought that skating needed a national organisation to control it, like the Jockey Club. The founding committee included several landowners, a vicar, a fellow of Trinity College, a magistrate, two members of parliament, the mayor of [Cambridge](2213), the Lord Lieutenant of [Cambridge](2213)shire, the president of [Cambridge](2213) University Skating Club, and Neville Goodman, a graduate of Peterhouse, [Cambridge](2213). Even though the National Skating Association was formed to regulate speed skating, figure skaters began joining the organization within a year of its founding.
The newly formed National Skating Association held their first one-and-a-half-mile British professional championship at Thorney in December 1879. There was a field of 32, including former champions Turkey Smart and Tom Watkinson. Fish Smart beat Knocker Carter in the final.  His reward was a badge, a sash and a cash prize, given as an annual salary in instalments to encourage the champion to "keep himself temperate". The NSA also established an amateur championship, which was held for the first time at Welsh Harp, London, in January 1880, and won by Frederick Norman, a farmerâ€™s son from Willingham. The professionals were labourers who skated for cash prizes; the amateurs were gentlemen who skated for trophies.
In 1892 the NSA aided in the foundation of the [International Skating Union](2264) (ISU). The NSA hosted the first international ice skating competition in Britain in [Birmingham](1398) in 1899 and has hosted all events in the UK since in various locations.
In 1894 the National Skating Association decided to move their headquarters from [Cambridge](2213) to London, from where they concentrated on figure skaters and rinkmen. Their new base, the National Skating Palace, is now better known as the London Palladium.
Until 1990, when an independent society was formed, the NSA was also the UK's governing body of roller skating. As a consequence of the segmentation, the NSA became NISA (National Ice Skating Association), the headquarters of which are now based in Nottingham.
In November 2018, the National Ice Skating Association began rebranding as British Ice Skating.

Assessment
Complying to the purpose of the organisation, the BIS levels are used by instructors to grade learners of ice skating in the UK. There are various levels of student grades, as well as instructor grades.

Skate UK Star Levels (formerly known as Passport)
These levels may be attempted once the Skate UK levels have been passed. Skate UK Star levels may be taken in any or all of singles skating (free), ice dance, speed skating or synchronised skating, although you must complete a level in a given discipline before moving onto the next level in that discipline. These levels as also assessed by the instructor, but will be expected to be of a higher standard than the same moves in the Skate UK system. The levels are as follows:

Judged Levels
These levels either go from 1 to 10 or correspond to competition categories (Basic Novice, Intermediate Novice, etc.) and are assessed by at least one BIS qualified judge. Skaters must show proof that they have completed the Skate UK Star programme before being allowed to apply for the judged levels. Tests are available in each of the following disciplines â€“ skaters may take tests in whichever disciplines they wish. Skaters do not need to complete the tests in every discipline before moving up to the next level, but cannot skip levels in any given discipline (i.e. must do Level 1 Field Moves before doing Level 2 Field Moves, but Level 1 Elements is not required to do Level 2 field moves).

Field Moves â€“ assessing control of edges
Elements â€“ these are elements of free skating such as jumps, spins and step sequences which are done in isolation
Free Skating â€“ using the elements in a continuous routine or program of a given length, set to music. Music for free skating must not have vocals.
Compulsory Dances â€“ there are 2 dances at each level. Dances may be tested solo or with a partner, although if both partners are taking the test either two judges are required or the partners will need to repeat each dance so that one is being assessed on the first time and one the second.
Variations (up to Level 2) â€“ this is done as part of the pattern of one of the compulsory dances followed by a specific number of bars of a dance to the same music which is invented by the skater (more usually their coach) followed by the end of the compulsory pattern. 2 full repeats must be skated.
Original Dance (Level 3 and above) â€“ a full routine to a given type of music with no compulsory dance sequence at the beginning.
Free Dance â€“ similar to the Free Skating this is a program of a given length, to music (which may include vocals), including certain required dance elements.
In summer 2020, BIS introduced new Interim Test Levels for Field Moves and Singles (Elements and Free) tests. The current levels will still be available for applications until 31st December 2020, after which time only the interim levels will be available.
