1914
Asia
[Asia](1914) (  AY-zh…ô, UK also  AY-sh…ô) is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population. It covers an area of more than 44 million square kilometres, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilisations. Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.
[Asia](1914) shares the landmass of Eurasia with [Europe](1994), and of [Afro-Eurasia](1134) with both [Europe](1994) and [Africa](1700). In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the [Arctic](590) Ocean. The border of [Asia](1914) with [Europe](1994) is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. A commonly accepted division places [Asia](1914) to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from [Africa](1700); and to the east of the Turkish straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from [Europe](1994).
Since the concept of [Asia](1914) derives from the term for the eastern region from a [Europe](1994)an perspective, [Asia](1914) is the remaining vast area of Eurasia minus [Europe](1994). Therefore, [Asia](1914) is a region where various independent cultures coexist rather than sharing a single culture, and the boundary between [Europe](1994) is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East‚ÄìWest cultural differences, some of which vary on a spectrum.
China and India traded places as the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a major economic power for much of recorded history, with the highest GDP per capita until 1500. The Silk Road became the main east‚Äìwest trading route in the [Asia](1914)n hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. [Asia](1914) has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. [Asia](1914) was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and many other religions.
[Asia](1914) varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties, and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in parts of West [Asia](1914), Central [Asia](1914) and South [Asia](1914), temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in North [Asia](1914).

Definition and boundaries
[Asia](1914)‚Äì[Africa](1700) boundary
The boundary between [Asia](1914) and [Africa](1700) is the Suez Canal, the Gulf of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Bab-el-Mandeb. This makes [Egypt](1987) a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in [Asia](1914) and the remainder of the country in [Africa](1700).

[Asia](1914)‚Äì[Europe](1994) boundary
The threefold division of the Old World into [Africa](1700), [Asia](1914), and [Europe](1994) has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between [Asia](1914) and [Europe](1994) along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the [Black Sea](1694) coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE. During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between [Europe](1994) and [Asia](1914) was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy.
The border between [Asia](1914) and [Europe](1994) was historically defined by [Europe](1994)an academics.
In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of [Asia](1914). Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the [Black Sea](1694) to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects. The border between the [Black Sea](1694) and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.

[Asia](1914)‚ÄìOceania boundary
The border between [Asia](1914) and Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia [Archipelago](1560), specifically in Eastern Indonesia. The Wallace Line separates the [Asia](1914)n and Wallacea biogeographical realms, a transition zone of deep water straits between the [Asia](1914)n and Australian continental shelves. Weber's Line split the region in two with regard to the balance of fauna between [Asia](1914)n origin or Australo-Papuan origin. Wallacea's eastern boundary with Sahul is represented by the Lydekker's Line. The Maluku Islands (except the Aru Islands) are often considered to lie on the border of southeast [Asia](1914), with the Aru Islands and Western New Guinea, to the east of the Lydekker's Line, being wholly part of Oceania, as both lie on the Australian continental plate. Culturally, the Wallacea region denoted the transition between Austronesian and Melanesian people, with varying degrees of intermixing between the two. In general, the further west and coastal a region is, the stronger the Austronesian influences, and the further east and inland a region is, the stronger the Melanesian influences. The terms Southeast [Asia](1914) and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian [Archipelago](1560) are [Asia](1914)n has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all [Europe](1994)an). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast [Asia](1914)' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."

[Asia](1914)‚ÄìNorth America boundary
The Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of [Asia](1914) and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the [United States](1100). This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the [United States](1100). The [Aleutian Islands](1150) are an island chain extending westward from the [Alaska](523)n Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on [Asia](1914)'s continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with [Asia](1914), which could then allow the U.S. state of [Alaska](523) as well as the [United States](1100) itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The [Aleutian Islands](1150) are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate. This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.
St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to [Alaska](523) and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [Alaska](523) and Russia are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).

Ongoing definition
Geographical [Asia](1914) is a cultural artifact of [Europe](1994)an conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. [Asia](1914) does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.
From the time of Herodotus, a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system ([Europe](1994), [Africa](1700), [Asia](1914)) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them. For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of [Europe](1994)an archeology at Oxford, argues that [Europe](1994) has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of [Asia](1914)".
Geographically, [Asia](1914) is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with [Europe](1994) being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. [Asia](1914), [Europe](1994) and [Africa](1700) make up a single continuous landmass‚Äî[Afro-Eurasia](1134)‚Äîand share a common continental shelf. Almost all of [Europe](1994) and a major part of [Asia](1914) sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.

Etymology
The term "[Asia](1914)" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age toponym Assuwa (Hittite: íÄ∏íãóíâø, romanized: a≈°-≈°u-wa) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE. Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term aswia (Mycenaean Greek: êÄÄêÄØêÄπêÄä, romanized: a-si-wi-ja), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.

Herodotus used the term in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the [Achaemenid Empire](1740), in contrast to Greece and [Egypt](1987). He reports that Greeks assumed that [Asia](1914) was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis. In Greek mythology, "[Asia](1914)" (·ºàœÉŒØŒ± or ·ºàœÉŒØŒ∑) was the name of a "Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia". The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning "[Asia](1914)n"); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as Œ±œÉŒπŒøœÇ.
The term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of [Asia](1914), located in western Anatolia. One of the first writers to use [Asia](1914) as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.

History
Ancient era
The history of [Asia](1914) can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East [Asia](1914), South [Asia](1914), Southeast [Asia](1914), Central [Asia](1914), and West [Asia](1914). The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilisations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilisations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilisations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.
The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of [Asia](1914) from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-[Europe](1994)ans, who spread their languages into West [Asia](1914), South [Asia](1914), and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of [Asia](1914), including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large equestrian force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

Medieval era
The Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West [Asia](1914) and southern parts of Central [Asia](1914) and western parts of South [Asia](1914) under its control during its conquests of the 7th century; Islam also spread over centuries to the southern regions of India and Southeast [Asia](1914) through trade along the Maritime Silk Road. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of [Asia](1914) in the 13th century, an area extending from China to [Europe](1994). Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.
The [Black Death](1693), one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central [Asia](1914), where it then travelled along the Silk Road.

Modern era
[Europe](1994)an involvement in [Asia](1914) became more significant from the [Age of Discovery](118) onward, with Iberian-sponsored sailors such as Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama paving the way for new routes from Atlantic [Europe](1994) to Pacific [Asia](1914) and the Indian Ocean respectively in the late 15th century. The Russian Empire also began to expand into northwestern [Asia](1914) from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central [Asia](1914) by the end of the 19th century. 
Among non-[Europe](1994)an empires, the Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North [Africa](1700) and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onward, while in the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire (preceded by the Delhi Sultanate of the 13th to early 16th century) and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.

Western imperialism in [Asia](1914) from the 18th to 20th centuries coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies. The British Empire first became dominant in South [Asia](1914), with most of the region being conquered by British traders in the late 18th and early 19th centuries before falling under direct British rule after a failed 1857 revolt; the 1869 completion of the Suez Canal, which increased British access to India, went on to further [Europe](1994)an influence over [Africa](1700) and [Asia](1914). Around this time, Western powers started to dominate China in what later became known as the century of humiliation, with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported. 
Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Japanese colonial empire, which controlled some of East [Asia](1914) and briefly much of Southeast [Asia](1914) (which had earlier been taken over by the British, Dutch and French in the late 19th century), New Guinea and the Pacific islands; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of [Asia](1914). One significant influence on Japan had been the [United States](1100), which had begun projecting influence across the Pacific after its early-to-mid-19th century westward expansion. The breakup of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century led to the Middle East also being contested and partitioned by the British and French.

Contemporary era
With the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of [Europe](1994) and imperial Japan, many countries in [Asia](1914) were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule. The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of South [Asia](1914)n Muslims, which in 1971 further split into the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh; Cold War tensions between the [United States](1100) and the Soviet Union strained relations between India and Pakistan and affected [Asia](1914) more generally. The end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union by 1991 saw the independence of the five modern Central [Asia](1914)n countries.
Some Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential, though stability in the Middle East has been affected since 1948 by the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and American-led interventions. East [Asia](1914)n nations (along with Singapore in Southeast [Asia](1914)) became economically prosperous with high-growth "tiger economies"; China, having undergone capitalistic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, regained its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century. India has also grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s, with extreme poverty now below 20%; India and China's rise has coincided with growing tension between the two, with the Indo-Pacific now an actively contested area between China and counterbalancing forces.

Geography
[Asia](1914) is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). [Asia](1914) is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma‚ÄìManych Depression) and the Caspian and [Black Sea](1694)s. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the [Arctic](590) Ocean. [Asia](1914) is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, [Azerbaijan](1588), Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in [Europe](1994). Geographically, Russia is partly in [Asia](1914), but is considered a [Europe](1994)an nation, both culturally and politically.
The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern [Asia](1914) and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

Main regions
There are various approaches to the regional division of [Asia](1914). The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). This division of [Asia](1914) into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.

North [Asia](1914) (Siberia)
Central [Asia](1914)
West [Asia](1914) (The Middle East or Near East and part of the Caucasus)
South [Asia](1914) (Indian subcontinent)
East [Asia](1914) (Far East)
Southeast [Asia](1914) (East Indies and Indochina)

Climate
[Asia](1914) has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from [Arctic](590) and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast [Asia](1914). It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of [Asia](1914). The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.

Climate change
Economy
[Asia](1914) has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region. As of 2023, China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked among the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values. Based on Global Office Locations 2011, [Asia](1914) dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in [Asia](1914): Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economy of China had an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. According to economic historian Angus Maddison, India had the world's largest economy during 1000 BCE and 1 CE. India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output. China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India. For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in [Asia](1914) and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [Europe](1994)an Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of [Asia](1914) combined. In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in [Asia](1914) since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the [Asia](1914)n tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having among the highest GDP per capita in [Asia](1914).

[Asia](1914) is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in [Asia](1914) has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast [Asia](1914), particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from [Europe](1994), North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in [Asia](1914)'s developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.
According to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from [Asia](1914) driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. [Asia](1914) has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.
Trade between [Asia](1914)n countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for [Asia](1914). Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Mal√© to East [Africa](1700) Mombasa (see also: Indo-Pacific), from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean (see also: Indo-Mediterranean), there via Haifa, Istanbul and [Athens](599) to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and [Eastern [Europe](1994)](1985) or further to [Barcelona](1000) and around Spain and France to the [Europe](1994)an northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South [Africa](1700) to [Europe](1994). A particularly significant part of the [Asia](1914)n goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. The melting of the [Arctic](590) is also paving the way for new shipping routes from Northeast [Asia](1914) to [Europe](1994) and North America. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to [Europe](1994) is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-[Asia](1914)n trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.
In 2010, [Asia](1914) had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. In 2011, [Asia](1914) topped [Europe](1994) in number of millionaires.
Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that [Asia](1914)n centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 [Asia](1914)n people mainly in Southeast [Asia](1914), China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western [Europe](1994) with 14,000 people.

Tourism
With growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by [Asia](1914) and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from [Asia](1914) (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.

Demographics
East [Asia](1914) had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.Nepal, a South [Asia](1914)n country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago. Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the "very high human development" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). [Afghanistan](1312) (155) ranked lowest amongst [Asia](1914)n countries out of the 169 countries assessed.

Languages
[Asia](1914) is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most [Asia](1914)n countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Religions
Many of the world's major religions have their origins in [Asia](1914), including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism. [Asia](1914)n mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah‚Äîand later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran‚Äîis earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the En√ªma Eli≈° and Epic of Gilgamesh. Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

Abrahamic
The [Abrahamic religions](1273) including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze faith, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith originated in West [Asia](1914).
Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in [Europe](1994), North America, and other regions; though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million, although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400), [Azerbaijan](1588) (9,100), Iran (8,756), India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000), among many other places. In total, there are 14.4‚Äì17.5 million (2016, est.) Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest [Asia](1914)n minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.
Christianity is a widespread religion in [Asia](1914) with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010, and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014. Christians constitute around 12.6% of the total population of [Asia](1914). In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In [Armenia](1567) and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion. In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations, which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West [Asia](1914) are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy. Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Significant Christian communities also found in Central [Asia](1914), South [Asia](1914), Southeast [Asia](1914) and East [Asia](1914).
Islam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in [Asia](1914) with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of [Asia](1914). With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.
The Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West [Asia](1914), is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and [Aristotle](162). The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million. About 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel. Recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.
The Bah√° º√≠ Faith originated in [Asia](1914), in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central [Asia](1914), India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bah√°'u'll√°h. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other [Asia](1914)n countries, because Bah√° º√≠ activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Bah√° º√≠ temple in India.

Indian and East [Asia](1914)n religions
Almost all [Asia](1914)n religions have philosophical character and [Asia](1914)n philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, CƒÅrvƒÅka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South [Asia](1914). In East [Asia](1914), particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.
As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of [Asia](1914)'s population and is the largest religion in [Asia](1914). However, it is mostly concentrated in South [Asia](1914). Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast [Asia](1914) and East [Asia](1914). Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%), Thailand (95%), Burma (80‚Äì89%), Japan (36‚Äì96%), Bhutan (75‚Äì84%), Sri Lanka (70%), Laos (60‚Äì67%) and Mongolia (53‚Äì93%). Taiwan (35‚Äì93%), South Korea (23‚Äì50%), Malaysia (19‚Äì21%), Nepal (9‚Äì11%), Vietnam (10‚Äì75%), China (20‚Äì50%), North Korea (2‚Äì14%), and small communities in India and Bangladesh. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.
Jainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the [United States](1100) and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of [Asia](1914), especially Southeast [Asia](1914). Confucianism is found predominantly in mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretised with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

Culture
The culture of [Asia](1914) is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central [Asia](1914), East [Asia](1914), North [Asia](1914), South [Asia](1914), Southeast [Asia](1914), and West [Asia](1914). These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West [Asia](1914), also known as Southwest [Asia](1914) or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilisations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the [Abrahamic religions](1273) of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. These civilisations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE. Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-[Asia](1914)n culture that is shared across the region.

Nobel laureates
The polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first [Asia](1914)n Nobel laureate.
