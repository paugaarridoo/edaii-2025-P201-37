Fragaria viridis
[Fragaria](2850) viridis, commonly called creamy strawberry or green strawberry is a species of strawberry native to [Europe](1994) and central [Asia](1914).  It has fruits with fine flavour. They have surprisingly little of the usual strawberry aroma, but a refreshing acidity, and sometimes ripen without becoming red. When they are plucked from the plant, the calyx will usually adhere and they will detach with a noticeable snapping sound.
All strawberries have a base haploid count of 7 chromosomes. [Fragaria](2850) viridis is diploid, having 2 pairs of these chromosomes for a total of 14 chromosomes. [Fragaria](2850) viridis is approximately 6.24 million years old.
