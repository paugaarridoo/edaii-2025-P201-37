California Strawberry Commission
The California [Strawberry](2800) Commission, is a state-chartered agency of the California Department of Food and Agriculture.  Established by the California State Legislature in 1993, the commission replaced the California [Strawberry](2800) Advisory Board.  The commission represents nearly 600 strawberry shippers, processors and growers within the state of California.
The commission is not funded by tax payers but by self-taxation or assessments on California strawberry growers.  The amount assessed is approved annually by the commission board of directors.  This assessment pays for the commission’s activities and projects.
The current president is Rick Tomlinson. He replaces Mark Murai, a third generation strawberry farmer from Orange County, California.

Activities and projects
The California [Strawberry](2800) Commission focuses activities and projects in:

Activities and projects are developed, approved and implemented under the authority of the commission’s board of directors.
The CSC's predecessor organization, the Board, popularized the use of soil fumigation starting in 1967 and it has remained vital ever since.
