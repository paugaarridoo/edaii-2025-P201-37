Albert Overhauser
Albert W. Overhauser (August 17, 1925 â€“ December 10, 2011) was an American physicist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He is best known for his theory of the Overhauser effect in nuclear magnetic resonance. The Overhauser effect was the first example of dynamic nuclear polarization whereby spin polarization is transferred from unpaired electrons in paramagnetic metals to nuclei resulting in a dramatic increase in their NMR intensity.

Life
Born in San Diego, California, Overhauser attended high school in San Francisco at Lick-Wilmerding High School  and began his undergraduate work at the University of California, Berkeley in 1942. He interrupted his studies during World War II for a two-year stint in the U.S. Navy Reserve, then returned to Berkeley to complete his education.
Overhauser received a Bachelor of Arts with major in physics and mathematics in 1948 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1952 in physics, both from the University of California, Berkeley. His doctoral advisor was Charles Kittel.
From 1951 to 1953, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, where he developed his highly cited theory on the transfer of spin polarization; once the theory had been confirmed and demonstrated by other scientists, it became known as the Overhauser effect. He was on the faculty at [Cornell University](3291) from 1953 to 1958, and then left to join the research staff at Ford Motor Company. Overhauser remained at Ford until 1973, when he joined the faculty at Purdue University. He remained at Purdue as the Stuart Distinguished Professor of Physics for the rest of his career. Overhauser died in 2011 in West Lafayette, Indiana.
