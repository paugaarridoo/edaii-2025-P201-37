Adorf
[Adorf](4510) (German pronunciation: ˈadɔʁf ) is a small town and municipality in the Vogtlandkreis to the south-west of the Free State of Saxony, Germany. Gettengrün, a village within the municipality, borders on the [Czech Republic](1975).

Etymology
The name [Adorf](4510) can be understood to mean "village on the water", the "A-" coming from an Old High German word for a stream or river (aha). Dorf is the Modern German word meaning village.

History
[Adorf](4510) was founded around 1200. In 1293 it gained the status of a "town". The town walls were commenced in 1477. Industries developed because of its favorable position and transport links: crafts, spinning, weaving, embroidery working with mother-of-pearl and musical instrument making. The  Johanniskirche was constructed in 1498. The town was destroyed by fire in 1768. The Freiberger Tor, the last remaining town gate in Vogtland, was rebuilt between 1768 and 1773 with a wooden framed upper storey. The current Rathaus was built in 1896- a period when many substantial houses were added to the streets round the market place.  It also housed a convalescent home for the poor of the city of Leipzig.
