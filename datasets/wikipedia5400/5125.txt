Ahmad ibn Ajiba
Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAjība al-Ḥasanī (Arabic: أحمد بن عجيبة; 1747–1809) was an influential 18th-century Moroccan scholar and poet in the Sunni Darqawa Sufi lineage.

Biography
He was born of a sharif family in the Anjra tribe that ranges from Tangiers to Tetuan along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco. As a child he developed a love of knowledge, memorizing the Qur'an and studying subjects ranging from Classical Arabic grammar, religious ethics, poetry, Qur'anic recitation and tafsir. When he reached the age of eighteen he left home and undertook the study of exoteric knowledge in Qasr al-Kabir under the supervision of Sidi Muhammad al-Susi al-Samlali. It was here that he was introduced to studies in the sciences, art, philosophy, law and Qur'anic exegesis in depth. He went to Fes to study with Mohammed al-Tawudi ibn Suda, Bennani, and El-Warzazi, and joined the new Darqawiyya in 1208 AH (1793), of which he was the representative in the northern part of the Jbala region. He spent nearly his entire life in and around Tetuan, and died of the plague in 1224 AH (1809). He is the author of over thirty works, including an autobiography, al-Fahrasa, which provides interesting information concerning the intellectual center that Tetuan had become by the beginning of the 19th century.
