Kerak telor
Kerak telor (English: Egg crust) is a Betawi traditional spicy omelette dish in Betawi cuisine. It is made from glutinous rice cooked with egg and served with serundeng (fried shredded coconut), fried shallots and dried shrimp as topping. It is considered as a snack and not as a main dish. The vendors of kerak telor are easily the most ubiquitous during the annual Jakarta Fair and it has also become a must-have menu item for visitors at the event.

Ingredients and method
Each of the portion is made by order. The kerak telor vendor puts a small amount of ketan (English: sticky rice) on a small wok pan and heats it on the charcoal fire. Then, he adds an egg (chicken or duck, but duck eggs are considered more delicious) and some spices and mixes them all. The dish is fried on a wok without any cooking oil, so the omelette will stick to the wok and enable him to put it upside down straight against a charcoal fire until it is cooked. The spicy serundeng (sweet grated coconut granule) with ebi (dried salted shrimp) and fried shallots are sprinkled upon the omelette.

History
In the Colonial era, kerak telor was a privileged food and was served in big parties for the colonial government or rich Betawi. According to the gastronomy expert, Suryatini N. Ganie, kerak telor was created in order to make glutinous rice more tasty and satisfying.
In modern times, kerak telor vendors are no longer dominated by native Jakartans; some of them come from Padang, Tegal, Garut, and Cimahi.
