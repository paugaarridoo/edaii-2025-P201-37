Aragüés Aragonese
Aragüés [Aragon](2509)ese is the [Aragon](2509)ese variety spoken in Aragüés and Jasa. It is very similar to Cheso, and better preserved than Aísa [Aragon](2509)ese.

Morphology
Define article system is lo, la, los, las.
The endings in indefinite past are -o as in Tensinian [Aragon](2509)ese: pagomos, (paguemos), cantoz, (cantez). In the third person in plural we have -oron just in the first conjugation: cantoron, but in the 2nd and in the 3rd person we have -ieron or -io(ro)n: salieron, partioron, riyeron, faborezión.
In irregular verbs with -i in present, we find this -i in yo foi but not in yo bó.
There are, as in Sobrarbe "strong perfects": fízon, trújon.
