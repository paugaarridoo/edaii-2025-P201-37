Adam in Islam
[Adam](110) (Arabic: آدم, romanized: ʾĀdam), in [Islam](5101)ic theology, is believed to have been the first human being on Earth and the first prophet (Arabic: نبي, nabī) of [Islam](5101). [Adam](110)'s role as the father of the human race is looked upon by Muslims with reverence. Muslims also refer to his wife, Ḥawwāʾ (Arabic: حَوَّاء, Eve), as the "mother of mankind". Muslims see [Adam](110) as the first Muslim, as the Quran states that all the Prophets preached the same faith of [Islam](5101) (Arabic: إسلام, lit. 'submission to God').
According to [Islam](5101)ic belief, [Adam](110) was created from the material of the earth and brought to life by God. God placed [Adam](110) in a paradisical Garden. After [Adam](110) sinned by eating from the forbidden tree (Tree of Immortality) after God forbade him from doing so, paradise was declined to him and he was sent down to live on Earth. This story is seen as both literal as well as an allegory for human relationship towards God. [Islam](5101) does not necessarily adhere to young Earth Creationism, and it is commonly held that life on Earth predates [Adam](110).

Qur'anic narrative
The Qur'an describes [Adam](110) in two different scenarios. In the first, [Adam](110) is created in heaven and the angels are commanded to prostrate themselves before him by God. In the second scenario, [Adam](110) dwells in a paradisical Garden with his wife identified as Ḥawwāʾ in [Islam](5101)ic tradition. While [Adam](110) and Eve are both mentioned in the Qur'an by name, their method of creation is neither explained nor specified.
The story of [Adam](110)'s creation evokes the idea of [Adam](110) as the "Primordial Man" to whom the angels need to prostrate themselves as a sign of respect. In a comment on Tafsir al-Baydawi, Gibril Haddad explains "he is also an archetype for the Attributes of [Allah](5160) Most High such as His life, knowledge and power, although an incomplete one." From the angels, only Iblis (Arabic: إِبْلِيسْ, romanized: Iblīs) refuses and is cast down from heaven and becomes the enemy of the heavenly [Adam](110).
In the story of the Garden, God tells [Adam](110) and Ḥawwāʾ that they are not allowed to consume the fruit of the "tree of immortality" (which [Islam](5101)ic tradition identifies with wheat). By promising immortality and "a kingdom that never decays", the Devil (Arabic: شَيْطَان, romanized: šayṭān) convinced them to taste it nonetheless: "He said, "Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals."" (7:21) Whereupon [Adam](110) and his wife are sent to earth, condemned to "live and die", but God is willing to forgive them.
When [Adam](110) was cast out of Garden Eden, [Adam](110) turned towards God and begged for forgiveness. [Islam](5101)ic exegesis regards [Adam](110) and Eve's expulsion from paradise not as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part, but as part of God's wisdom (Arabic: حكمة, romanized: hikmah) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and his creative power. Therefore, there is not a doctrine of original sin in [Islam](5101)ic theology (Kalām) and [Adam](110)'s sin is not carried by all of his children.
The Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ (Arabic: قصص الأنبياء, lit. 'Tales of the Prophets') adds that [Adam](110) and Ḥawwāʾ, when cast out of paradise, were cast down far apart from each other, and eventually met each other at Mount Arafat. Humankind would have inherently learned much from [Adam](110), such as planting, harvesting, baking, repenting, and proper burial.

Theological significance
[Adam](110) features as an archetype of humans and their relationship to God in Muslim theology and philosophy. According to hadiths, [Adam](110) was created in God's own image, and according to 2:31 of the Qur'an, was "taught all the names by God", thus establishing the notion of [Adam](110) as a reflection of God's divine attributes. By that, [Adam](110) does not feature as a prophet or a male human being only, but also encapsulates the idea of an ideal human archetype. Since God has forgiven [Adam](110)'s transgression, humans are not viewed as inherently sinful or in need of redemption. Instead, [Adam](110) (or humanity) is viewed as being created from a relationship to God through learning and development.
Suhrawardi (c. 1145 – 1234) discusses the nature of human's soul as a mixture between [Adam](110) and Hawwa; [Adam](110) referring to the heavenly attributes and Hawwa to earthly animalistic passion. Through a mixture of both, the human soul (Arabic: نَفْس, romanized: nafs, lit. 'self') is fashioned and becomes a personal animal soul. He based his anthropology on Qur'anic verses such as "He who has created you all out of one living entity, and out of it brought into being its mate, so that man might incline with love towards the woman" (7:189).
According to Tafsir al-Baydawi (d.1319), [Adam](110) might stand for an original pattern for all of the spiritual and the corporeal existence or  serving as a way for angels to obtain their allotted perfections by submitting to God's command to prostrate before him.: 508  Ibn Arabi explains that only [Adam](110) can comprehend all the names of God, thereby referring to the perfected heavenly [Adam](110) as a reflection of God's names. When Iblis failed to submit to God's command, he attributed injustice to the reality (Arabic: ٱلْحَقُّ, romanized: al-haqq).

‘Iṣmah
Muslim scholars can be divided into two groups regarding [Adam](110)'s infallibility (Arabic: عِصْمَة, romanized: 'Ismah): One argues that [Adam](110) only became a prophet after he was cast out of paradise. They adhere to the doctrine that ‘iṣmah only applies to prophets after they were sent to a mission. But since there was no population to whom [Adam](110) could have been sent, he could not have been a prophet and therefore ‘iṣmah did not apply until he left paradise. These arguments are, however, rejected by those who argue that prophethood does not start with preaching God's word and instead begins at birth itself. According to the second point of view, [Adam](110) was predestined by God to eat from the forbidden tree because God planned to set [Adam](110) and his progeny on earth from the beginning and thus installed [Adam](110)'s fall.: 194  In that regard, [Adam](110) would not have truly disobeyed, but acted in accordance with God's will to his best ability. For that reason, many Muslim exegetes do not regard [Adam](110) and Eve's expulsion from paradise as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part,: 171  but as part of God's wisdom (Arabic: حكمة, romanized: hikmah) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation. By their former abode in paradise, they can hope for return during their life-time.
Some Muslim scholars view [Adam](110) as an image for his descendants: humans sin, become aware of it, repent (Arabic: توبة, romanized: tawbah), and find their way back to God. [Adam](110) embodies humanity and his fall shows humans how to act when they sin.: 194  Unlike Iblis (Satan), [Adam](110) asked for forgiveness for his transgression.

[Adam](110) and the angels
The story of angels prostrating before [Adam](110) gave rise to various debates about whether humans or angels rank higher. Angels bowing down before [Adam](110) is mentioned as evidence for human superiority over the angels. Others hold that the prostration does not imply such a thing, but was merely a command or test for the angels. A position, especially found among Mu'tazilites and some Asharites, holds that angels are superior due to their lack of urges and desires. Maturidism generally does not think any of these creatures is superior to the other, and that angels' and prophets' obedience derive from their virtues and insights to God's action, but not as their original purity.
In the Qur'anic version of [Adam](110)'s fall, Satan tempted them with the promise to become immortal angels. Al-Qushayri comments on 7:20, that [Adam](110)'s fall is for his wish to be like an angel, while angels' fall is because when they desired to be like human. [Adam](110) desired an angelic state of no passion and avoiding the fate of death, while Harut and Marut desired the freedom of choice and to rejoice in extravagance.

Life before [Adam](110)
It is evident from the Qur'an that [Adam](110) was the father of contemporary humanity,: 21  but the claim that there was sentient life before him is debated. According to some views, God created an [Adam](110) thirty times, every 1000 years. After the downfall of each humanity, God left the world uninhabited for 50,000 years, then 50,000 inhabited, and then a new [Adam](110) was created.: 195  The majority of scholars, however, reject this opinion, but they agree that the jinn and animals have lived on earth before. According to the Majallat Al Azhar, nowhere within [Islam](5101)ic texts is it prescribed how long humans existed and every Muslim is free to think that is right, and that the notion of a young earth derives from biblical reports (Israʼiliyyat).: 196  Süleyman Ateş used Quranic verses to disprove the Creationistic interpretation of the [Adam](110) narrative.

Creation of [Adam](110)
Ahadīth, incorporated in both tafsīr and qaṣaṣ ul-anbiyāʾ, offer detailed descriptions about the creation of [Adam](110). Although they vary in detail, the following components are essential:

God orders the angels to collect dust from the earth to create [Adam](110).
Dust is taken from various places, influencing [Adam](110)'s descendants.
Mythological meaning behind the name of the first human
[Adam](110) lies immobile for forty years and [Adam](110) hastily tries to rise up unable to do so.
[Adam](110) sneezes and says al-hamdu li-allah (Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, lit. 'All praise is for [Allah](5160)')
Some of these components appear in both Jewish and [Islam](5101)ic traditions alike. The idea that God orders angels to collect dust from earth is, however, unique to [Islam](5101). It is only later adapted in the Chronicles of Jerahmeel. [Islam](5101) usually has Azrael being successful, taking the earth despite earth's pleads not to do so. For his merciless withstanding, he earns his position as the angel of death. This further shows that life and death are intertwined. Only in one brief reference by [Al-Tabari](5151), it is Iblis, not Azrael who collects dust from earth, leading to his claim to be superior.
Both Jewish and Muslim sources agree that dust for the creation of [Adam](110)'s body was taken from the entire world, and often a specific sacred place. However, they differ in regards the identity of the sacred places and the meaning of the gathering of dust from the world. While Jewish tradition identifies sacred places from Israel or the altar of the Temple, Muslim sources identify the place with Mecca or the Ka'aba. According to the Muslim interpretation, dust collected from all around the earth explains the differences among humankind, such as skin-color, but insist that humanity as a whole is united and stems from the ancestry of [Adam](110).

Genealogy of [Adam](110)
It has been said that Eve went through 120 pregnancies with [Adam](110) and each of these consisted of a set of twins: a boy and a girl. In some other traditions, their first child was a girl, born alone, called ʿAnāq. According to several sources, God took all of [Adam](110)'s progeny from his back while they were still in heaven. He asked each of them "am I not your lord?" as read in verse 7:172 of the Qur'an and they all affirmed. For this reason, it is believed that all humans are born with an innate knowledge of God. The most famous of [Adam](110)'s children are Cain and Abel. Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain. As [Adam](110) grieved his son, he would preach to his other children about God and faith in Him. When [Adam](110)'s death grew near, he appointed his son Seth as his successor.
Ibn Jarir at-Tabari reported that Hawwa’ bore [Adam](110) one hundred and twenty sets of twins. The first of them were Qabil and his twin sister Qalima, and the last of them was ‘Abd al-Mughith and his twin sister Amat al-Mughith. Ibn Ishaq was quoted as saying that all the children that Hawwa’ bore [Adam](110) were forty children, male and female, from twenty twin pregnancies. And he said: The names of some of them have come down to us, and the names of others have not."
[Islam](5101)ic scholar Sayyid Mumtaz Ali, while commenting on whether [Adam](110) was first or Eve, says that "the fact that [Adam](110) was created first is nothing but childish. To begin with, we are tempted to assert that this is so because it was not acceptable to God that a woman is left without a companion for even a second. Therefore, it is for her sake that he created [Adam](110) first. But as a matter of fact, the belief that [Adam](110) was created first and then came Eve is part of the Christian and Jewish faith. This is not at all part of the [Islam](5101)ic creed. There is no mention in the Qur'an about who was created first, [Adam](110) or Eve."
