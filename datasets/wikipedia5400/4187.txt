Royal Society Bakerian Medal
The Bakerian Medal is one of the premier medals of the Royal Society that recognizes exceptional and outstanding science. It comes with a medal award and a prize lecture. The medalist is required to give a lecture on any topic related to physical sciences. It is awarded annually to individuals in the field of physical sciences, including computer science.

History
The prize was started in 1774, when Henry Baker left £100 to establish a spoken lecture given by a Fellow of the Royal Society about natural history or experimental philosophy.
