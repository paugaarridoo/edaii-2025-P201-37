Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon
The coat of arms of the Crown of [Aragon](2509) bears four red pallets on a gold background, and it depicts the familiar coat of the Kings of [Aragon](2509). It differs from the flag because this latter instead uses bars. It is one of the oldest coats of arms in Europe dating back to a seal of Raymond Berengar IV, Count of [Barcelona](1000) and Prince of [Aragon](2509), from 1150.
Today, this symbol has been adopted and/or included in their arms by several former territories related to the Crown of [Aragon](2509), like the arms of Spain, which wears it in its third quarter (whereas the Kings of Spain are heirs of those of [Aragon](2509)); or the arms of [Andorra](1549), which shows it on two of its quarters. It is also the main element of the arms of the present Spanish autonomous communities of [Catalonia](2549), Valencian Community and the [Balearic Islands](2515); the fourth quarter of the Spanish autonomous community of [Aragon](2509); it is present on the arms of the French administrative regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Occitania (whose department of the Pyrénées-Orientales regroups the old provinces of Roussillon and Upper Cerdanya); and in the Italian provinces of Reggio Calabria and Catanzaro in Calabria, and Lecce in Apulia. It figures also in numerous located municipal blazons in the former territories of the Crown, either by explicit concession of the king, or because they were cities or towns of realengo (that is, directly dependent on the Crown and subject to no kind of manorialism); and others outside it, in which case the symbol is because of the presence of the king or knights of the Crown at some moment of their local history.

Heraldic description
The blazon of the arms is: Or, four pallets of gules. In heraldry, the escutcheon is commonly known as that of [Aragon](2509).
These pallets of gules are commonly named in popular usage and culture as the "red bars" or the "four bars".
It has been described on the Middle Ages armorials as in "Armorial du Hérault Vermandois", 1285–1300, as that of the King of [Aragon](2509), naming specifically Peter III as one of the bearers, is described as These are the arms of the Counts of [Barcelona](1000) who acquired Aragón by marriage (...), the one of Count of [Barcelona](1000) is the same or three pallets gules, the arms of the King of Majorca are those of [Aragon](2509), with the coat of arms of James II, King of Majorca being or four pallets gules a bend azure and the one of the King of Ternacle d [Aragon](2509) et Ternacle en flanquiet lun dedans lautre (...) Per pale or four pallets gules and argent (...). The coat of arms with the four red pales on a gold background appears on several other coats of arms, named as "of [Aragon](2509)".

Also mentioned in Armorial de Gelre, 1370–1395, the coat of arms of Peter IV Die Coninc von Arragoen is golden with four pallers of gulets or the Armorial d'Urfé, 1380, sont les armes de le Conte de Cathalogne, and in armorial de Charolais, 1425, arms conte de Barselongne and armorial Le Blanq (sources from 1420 to 1450) venant des contes de Barselone, armorial Wijnbergen, King of [Aragon](2509) or four pallets gules

History
Originally it was the familiar emblem of the Kings of [Aragon](2509) and Counts of [Barcelona](1000). In 1137, when [Aragon](2509) and the County of [Barcelona](1000) merged by dynastic union by the marriage of Raymond Berengar IV of [Barcelona](1000) and Petronila of [Aragon](2509), these titles were finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of [Aragon](2509) ascended to the throne in 1162. Slowly the various entities and territories over which the House of [Aragon](2509)-[Barcelona](1000) ruled and came to rule came to be called the Crown of [Aragon](2509).
"The new ruler of the united dynasty (Raymond Berenger IV of [Barcelona](1000)) called himself count of [Barcelona](1000) and "prince" of Aragón."
The son of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronila, Alfonso II, inherited both the titles of King of [Aragon](2509) and Count of [Barcelona](1000), in a style that would be maintained by all its successors to the crown. Thus, this union was made while respecting the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories.
It constitutes the third quarter section of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Spain.

Theories of origin
Theories of Catalan origin
The oldest evidence where the arms can be seen is from 1150, in a seal of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of [Barcelona](1000). The seal evidence is disputed by some [Aragon](2509)ese authors who claim that the first documented evidence dates from the reign of Alfonso II, king of [Aragon](2509) and count of [Barcelona](1000).
As a pre-heraldic symbol, the red bars on a yellow background are found on the Romanesque tombs of [Barcelona](1000)'s Count Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'estopes, who died in 1082, and his great-grandmother Ermessenda, who died in 1058, wife of Count Ramon Borrell I, both of whose tombs were at the portico of the old Romanesque Cathedral of Girona; it is not sure that the 15 bars of gold appearing in a painting are contemporary to the tombs. It is a proof that relates the arms to the Counts of [Barcelona](1000) lineage and the pre-heraldic forms indicate pre-heraldic times, before the second third of the 12th century.

Theories of [Aragon](2509)ese origin
The exact origin of the four bars symbol is obscure, and for long it has been explained by legends, now proven false. The first undisputed evidences are from the Alfonso II (king of [Aragon](2509) and count of [Barcelona](1000)) reign.
Even though a purely [Aragon](2509)ese origin for the four bars symbol has been proposed, the main point held by [Aragon](2509)ese authors (Fatás, Ubieto, Montaner), partially supported by some Catalan historians like Ferran de Segarra, is that the key evidence for the Catalan origin, the Marseilles seals, is dubious. The lines in the monochrome Marseilles seals are interpreted as mere scratchings by some, and as representation of a shield reinforcement by others. This theory was rejected by [Aragon](2509)ese member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez-Pidal.
A second point put forward by [Aragon](2509)ese authors is that Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of [Barcelona](1000) was the de facto ruler of [Aragon](2509), even if only his son Alfonso II would become de jure king of [Aragon](2509). Therefore, any symbol associated with Ramon Berenguer IV can also be attributed to the then budding Crown of [Aragon](2509).
