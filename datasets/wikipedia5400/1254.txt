1254
2022 Nobel Peace Prize
The [2022 Nobel Peace Prize](1254) was awarded jointly to one individual and two organisations which advocate human rights and civil liberty. The recipients were the Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski (born 1962), the Russian human rights organisation Memorial (founded in 1989) and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties (founded in 2007). The citation given by the Norwegian Nobel Committee were the following: The Peace Prize laureates represent civil society in their home countries. They have for many years promoted the right to criticise power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens. They have made an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power. Together they demonstrate the significance of civil society for peace and democracy.

Reactions
In Ukraine the joint awarding to organisations from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus was criticised by journalists for allegedly upholding the Russian nationalist stereotype of the "three brotherly people". The choice of the committee to award the prize while Russia and Ukraine were at war (with Belarus giving logistical support to the Russian army) was also criticised. According to the Center for Civil Liberties (in a press conference on 8 October 2022) "In no way should this award sound like an old narrative about fraternal nations" but "this story is about resistance to common evil." At the time of the press conference neither Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy nor any other (Ukrainian) government official had congratulated the Center for Civil Liberties on winning the Nobel Prize.

Candidates
Prior to his 2022 Ales Bialiatski's Nobel Peace Prize, he was nominated five times unsuccessfully. According to the Nobel Committee, there were 343 candidates for the [2022 Nobel Peace Prize](1254), out of which 251 are individuals and 92 are organisations, becoming the second highest number recorded in history.
