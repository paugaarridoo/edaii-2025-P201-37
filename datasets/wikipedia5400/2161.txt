1923 in association football
The following are the football (soccer) events of the year 1923 throughout the world.

Events
March 16 – Finnish association football club, Kuopion Palloseura is founded.
April 18 – Russian professional sports club, Dynamo Moscow, is founded.
April 28 – The first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley Stadium,  between Bolton Wanderers F.C. and West Ham United F.C. Known as the White Horse Final due to the memorable image of a policeman on a white horse marshalling the crowds. With an official maximum capacity of 127,000, the attendance was quoted as 126,947 but up to 240,000 people are thought to have squeezed in through the 104 turnstiles by the time the gates were closed, leaving tens of thousands still queuing outside. The White Horse Final has the highest ever unofficial "non-racing" sports attendance in the world, which is very unlikely to be broken in the near future. This claim, however, is disputed, as the Maracana held 199,854 fans during the 1950 World Cup final between Brazil and Uruguay.
June 25 – [Association football](2100) club FC Rapid București is formed, on the initiative of the Grivița railroad workers (first named CFR București).
