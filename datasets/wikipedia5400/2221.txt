Continental Europe
Continental [Europe](1994) or mainland [Europe](1994) is the contiguous mainland of [Europe](1994), excluding its surrounding islands. It can also be referred to ambiguously as the [Europe](1994)an continent, – which can conversely mean the whole of [Europe](1994) – and, by some, simply as the Continent. When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, [Europe](1994) is treated both as a continent and subcontinent.

Usage
The continental territory of the historical Carolingian Empire was one of the many old cultural concepts used for mainland [Europe](1994). This was consciously invoked in the 1950s as one of the basis for the prospective [Europe](1994)an integration (see also multi-speed [Europe](1994))
The most common definition of mainland [Europe](1994) excludes these continental islands: the Greek islands, Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Great Britain and Ireland and surrounding islands, Novaya Zemlya and the Nordic archipelago, as well as nearby oceanic islands, including the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Svalbard.
The Scandinavian Peninsula is sometimes also excluded even though it is a part of "mainland [Europe](1994)", as the de facto connections to the rest of the continent were historically across the [Baltic Sea](182) or North Sea (rather than via the lengthy land route that involves travelling to the north of the peninsula where it meets [Finland](2238), and then south through northeast [Europe](1994)). The Øresund Bridge now links the Scandinavian road and rail networks to those of Western [Europe](1994).

Great Britain and Ireland
In both Great Britain and Ireland, the Continent is widely and generally used to refer to the mainland of [Europe](1994). An amusing British newspaper headline supposedly once read, "Fog in Channel; Continent Cut Off". It has also been claimed that this was a regular weather forecast in Britain in the 1930s. In addition, the word [Europe](1994) itself is also regularly used to mean [Europe](1994) excluding the islands of Great Britain, Iceland, and Ireland (although the term is often used to refer to the [Europe](1994)an Union). The term mainland [Europe](1994) is also sometimes used. Usage of these terms may reflect political or cultural allegiances, for example it has been observed that there is a correlation between whether a British citizen considers themselves "British" or "[Europe](1994)an" and whether they live in an area which primarily supported Brexit.
Derivatively, the adjective continental refers to the social practices or fashion of continental [Europe](1994). Examples include breakfast, topless sunbathing and, historically, long-range driving (before Britain had motorways) often known as Grand Touring. Differences include electrical plugs, time zones for the most part, the use of left-hand traffic, and for the United Kingdom, currency and the continued use of certain imperial units alongside the metric units which have long since displaced customary units in continental [Europe](1994).
Britain is physically connected to continental [Europe](1994) through the undersea Channel Tunnel (the longest undersea tunnel in the world), which accommodates both the Eurotunnel Shuttle (passenger and vehicle use – vehicle required) and Eurostar (passenger use only) services. These services were established to transport passengers and vehicles through the tunnel on a 24/7 basis between [England](1990) and continental [Europe](1994), while still maintaining passport and immigration control measures on both sides of the tunnel. This route is popular with refugees and migrants seeking to enter the UK.

Scandinavia
Especially in Germanic studies, continental refers to the [Europe](1994)an continent excluding the Scandinavian Peninsula, Britain, Ireland, and Iceland. The reason for this is that although the Scandinavian peninsula is attached to continental [Europe](1994), and accessible via a land route along the 66th parallel north, it is usually reached by sea.
Kontinenten ("the Continent") is a vernacular Swedish expression that refers to an area excluding [Sweden](1600), Norway, and [Finland](2238) but including Denmark (even the Danish Archipelago which is technically not a part of continental [Europe](1994)) and the rest of continental [Europe](1994). In Norway, similarly, one speaks about Kontinentet as a separate entity. In Denmark, Jutland is referred to as the mainland and thereby a part of continental [Europe](1994).
The Scandinavian Peninsula is now connected to the Danish mainland (the Jutland Peninsula) by several bridges and tunnels.

Mediterranean and Atlantic islands
The Continent may sometimes refer to the continental part of France (excluding Corsica and overseas France), the continental part of Greece (excluding the Aegean Islands, Crete, and the Ionian Islands), the continental part of Italy (excluding Sardinia, Sicily, etc.), the continental part of Portugal (excluding the Azores and Madeira), and the continental part of Spain (excluding the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, the plazas de soberanía, etc.). The term is used from the perspective of the island residents of each country to describe the continental portion of their country or the continent (or mainland) as a whole.
Metropolitan France is also known as l'Hexagone, "the Hexagon", referring to its approximate shape on a map. Continental Italy is also known as lo Stivale, "the Boot", referring to its approximate shape on a map. Continental Spain is referred to as peninsular Spain.
