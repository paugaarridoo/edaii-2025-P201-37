Catalan dialects
The Catalan dialects (and restrictively also, Valencian dialects) feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between its dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Alguerese dialect.

Geographic classifications
Overview of main varieties and areas
Western vs. Eastern
In 1861, linguist Manuel Milà i Fontanals split Catalan into two main dialectal blocks: Western and Eastern. The most obvious phonetic difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e, which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.
Western Catalan comprises the two varieties of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises three to four varieties (depending on their classification): [Central Catalan](4393), Roussillonese (Northern Catalan), and Insular (Balearic and Alguerese). Each variety can be further subdivided into several subdialects.
There are two spoken standards for the language based on the Eastern and Western dialects respectively:

In [Catalonia](2549), the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC) regulates the spoken standard based on [Central Catalan](4393), which has the highest number of speakers and is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.
In the Valencian Community (a.k.a. Valencian Country), the [Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua](4204) (AVL) adapts the Fabran guidelines to the Valencian variety, and regulates an alternative spoken standard based on the Southern Valencian dialect (especially Upper Southern Valencian). Despite having fewer speakers than the Central Valencian dialect, Southern Valencian (except the southernmost subdialects) has been less influenced by Spanish. It is spoken in the South and North of the Valencia and Alicante provinces respectively, in cities such as Alcoi, Dénia, Gandia and Xàtiva.
Valencians are only surpassed in number of Catalan-speakers by Catalans themselves, representing approximately a third of the whole Catalan-speaking population. Therefore, in the context of linguistic conflict, recognition and respect towards the dual standard, as well as the dual Catalan–Valencian denomination, pacifies the tense central–periphery relations between [Catalonia](2549) and the Valencian Community.

Continental vs. Insular
The Continental varieties of Catalan and Valencian may refer to:

Northern, Central and North-Western Catalan, all spoken in mainland [Catalonia](2549) (and Roussillon), and Valencian, spoken in the Valencian Community. Exceptions may include the Majorcan spoken by certain communities in the Valencian towns of Tàrbena and La Vall de Gallinera in the region of la Marina.
Insular Catalan may refer to:

the Balearic subdialects, mainly spoken on the islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca (wide definition).
Alguerese, the Catalan variety spoken in the Sardinian city of [Alghero](4217).

Pronunciation
Vowels
Catalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish, Asturian, and [Aragon](2509)ese. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.
In Eastern Catalan (except most of Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ → ə; /o, ɔ, u/ → u; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced e, o in some words. Alguerese has lowered ə to a, similar to Eastern dialects spoken in the Barcelona metropolitan area (however, in the latter dialects the vowels are distinct as ɐ vs. a).
In Majorcan (except in some parts of in the northern of the island), unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to o, with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.
In Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ → e; /o, ɔ/ → o; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.
Central, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in central and western Catalan as well. As a result, Western Catalan has a much higher incidence of /e/.

Note, the quality of vowels also varies across dialects, and they may present a wide range of contextual allophones. For further information see Catalan phonology#Vowels.

au ('bird') vs. ou ('egg') - Southern Valencian (as /a/).

Consonants
Catalan and Valencian dialects are characterised by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals (/l, ʎ/).
Most Catalan and Valencian dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarisation of /l/ → ɫ), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation). 
There is dialectal variation in regard to:

The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).
While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.
The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme /v/.
The pronunciation or not of yod (/j/) in the digraph ⟨ix⟩.
The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either /ɾ/ or /r/).
The delateralisation of the palatal lateral approximant (/ʎ/).
The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as /b/ in poble 'village, people' → β vs. b vs. bː vs. p vs. pː).
Consonant mergers (between dialects) include:

General consonant mergers in both General Catalan and Valencian:
cub ('cube') vs. cup ('winepress') - as /p/.
tord ('thrush') vs. tort ('crooked') - as /t/.
mag ('magician') vs. mac ('pebble') - as /k/.

Morphology
In Western Catalan, the 1st person present indicative ending for verbs is -e (∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugation), or -o. For example, parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western). In Eastern Catalan, the 1st person present indicative ending for verbs is -o, -i or ∅ in all conjugations. For example, parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), parli (Northern); all meaning "I speak".

In Western Catalan, the inchoative desinences for verbs are -isc/-ixo, -ix, -ixen, -isca. In Eastern Catalan, the inchoative desinences for verbs are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.
In Western Catalan, the /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone nouns and adjectives is maintained. For example, hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'. In Eastern Catalan, the /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone nouns and adjectives is lost. For example, homes 'men', joves 'youth'.

Vocabulary
Despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually [Central Catalan](4393) acts as an innovative element.
