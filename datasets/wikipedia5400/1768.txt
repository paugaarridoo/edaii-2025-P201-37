Africa
[Afri](1746)ca is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area. With nearly 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. [Afri](1746)ca's population is the youngest among all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Based on 2024 projections, [Afri](1746)ca's population will reach 3.8 billion people by 2099. [Afri](1746)ca is the least wealthy inhabited continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate, corruption, colonialism, the Cold War, and neocolonialism. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and a large and young population make [Afri](1746)ca an important economic market in the broader global context. [Afri](1746)ca has a large quantity of natural resources and food resources, including diamonds, sugar, salt, gold, iron, cobalt, uranium, copper, bauxite, silver, petroleum, natural gas, cocoa beans, and tropical fruit.
The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Arabian Plate and the Gulf of Aqaba to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the [Atlantic Ocean](1580) to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight cities and islands that are part of non-[Afri](1746)can states, and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. This count does not include Malta and Sicily, which are geologically part of the [Afri](1746)can continent. [Algeria](1317) is [Afri](1746)ca's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. [Afri](1746)can nations cooperate through the establishment of the [Afri](1746)can Union, which is headquartered in [Addis Ababa](1742).
[Afri](1746)ca straddles the equator and the prime meridian. It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones. The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of Western Sahara, [Algeria](1317), Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, and the entire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla, and Tunisia, which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. In the other extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, great parts of South [Afri](1746)ca, the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone.
[Afri](1746)ca is highly biodiverse; it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. However, [Afri](1746)ca also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, and pollution. These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts [Afri](1746)ca. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified [Afri](1746)ca as the continent most vulnerable to climate change.
The history of [Afri](1746)ca is long, complex, and varied, and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community. In [Afri](1746)can societies the oral word is revered, and they have generally recorded their history via oral tradition, which has led anthropologists to term them oral civilisations, contrasted with literate civilisations which pride the written word.: 142–143  During the colonial period, oral sources were deprecated by European historians, which gave them the impression [Afri](1746)ca had no recorded history. [Afri](1746)can historiography became organized at the academic level in the mid-20th century, and saw a movement towards utilising oral sources in a multidisciplinary approach, culminating in the General History of [Afri](1746)ca, edited by specialists from across the continent.
[Afri](1746)ca, particularly Eastern [Afri](1746)ca, is widely accepted to be the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade, also known as the great apes. The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, and Homo sapiens (modern human) are believed to have originated in [Afri](1746)ca 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. [Afri](1746)ca is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited. In the 4th and 3rd millennia BC [Ancient Egypt](138), Kerma, Punt, and the Tichitt Tradition emerged in North, East and West [Afri](1746)ca, while from 4000 BC until 1000 AD the Bantu expansion was substantial in laying the foundations for societies and states in Central, East, and Southern [Afri](1746)ca. Some [Afri](1746)can empires include Wagadu, Mali, Songhai, Sokoto, Ife, Benin, Asante, the Fatimids, Almoravids, Almohads, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Kongo, Mwene Muji, Luba, Lunda, Kitara, Aksum, Ethiopia, Adal, Ajuran, Kilwa, Sakalava, Imerina, Maravi, Mutapa, Rozvi, Mthwakazi, and Zulu. Slave trades created various diasporas, especially in the Americas. From the late 19th century to early 20th century, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, most of [Afri](1746)ca was rapidly conquered and colonised by European nations, save for Ethiopia and Liberia. European rule had significant impacts on [Afri](1746)ca's societies, and colonies were maintained for the purpose of economic exploitation and extraction of natural resources. Most present states emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II, and established the Organisation of [Afri](1746)can Unity in 1963, the predecessor to the [Afri](1746)can Union. The nascent countries decided to keep their colonial borders, with traditional power structures used in governance to varying degrees.

Etymology
[Afri](1746) was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of what was then known as northern [Afri](1746)ca, located west of the Nile river, and in its widest sense referring to all lands south of the Mediterranean, also known as Ancient Libya. This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern Berbers; see Terence for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the Phoenician word ʿafar meaning "dust", but a 1981 hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the Berber word ifri (plural ifran) meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers. The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from [Algeria](1317) and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya, as well as the city of Ifrane in Morocco.
Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province then named [Afri](1746)ca Proconsularis, following its defeat of the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya. The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim region of Ifriqiya, following its conquest of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's Exarchatus [Afri](1746)cae, also preserved a form of the name.
According to the Romans, [Afri](1746)ca lies to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 CE), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and [Afri](1746)ca. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "[Afri](1746)ca" expanded with their knowledge.
Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "[Afri](1746)ca":

The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of [Abraham](1735) according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
Isidore of Seville in his 7th-century Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests "[Afri](1746)ca" comes from the Latin aprica, meaning "sunny".
Massey, in 1881, stated that [Afri](1746)ca is derived from the Egyptian af-rui-ka, meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The Ka is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. [Afri](1746)ca would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."
Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed linking the Latin word with africus "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
Robert R. Stieglitz of Rutgers University in 1984 proposed: "The name [Afri](1746)ca, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew Ophir 'rich'."
Ibn Khallikan and some other historians claim that the name of [Afri](1746)ca came from a Himyarite king called [Afri](1746)kin ibn Kais ibn Saifi ("[Afri](1746)kus son of [Abraham](1735)") who subdued Ifriqiya.
Arabic afrīqā (feminine noun) and ifrīqiyā, now usually pronounced afrīqiyā (feminine) '[Afri](1746)ca', from 'afara ' = 'ain, not 'alif 'to be dusty' from 'afar 'dust, powder' and 'afir 'dried, dried up by the sun, withered' and 'affara 'to dry in the sun on hot sand' or 'to sprinkle with dust'.
Possibly Phoenician faraqa in the sense of 'colony, separation'.

History
History in [Afri](1746)ca
In [Afri](1746)can societies, the historical process is largely a communal one, with eyewitness accounts, hearsay, reminiscences, and occasionally visions, dreams, and hallucinations crafted into narrative oral traditions which are performed and transmitted through generations.: 12 : 48  Time is sometimes mythical and social, and truth generally viewed as relativist.: 43–53  In [Afri](1746)can epistemology, the epistemic subject "experiences the epistemic object in a sensuous, emotive, intuitive, abstractive understanding, rather than through abstraction alone, as is the case in Western epistemology" to arrive at a "complete knowledge", and as such oral traditions, music, proverbs, and the like were used in the preservation and transmission of knowledge. Oral tradition can be exoteric or esoteric. It speaks to people according to their understanding, unveiling itself in accordance with their aptitudes, and is not always to be taken literally.: 168

Prehistory
[Afri](1746)ca is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth, with the Human species originating from the continent. During the mid-20th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as seven million years ago (Before present, BP). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern humans, such as Australopithecus afarensis radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0 million years BP, Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4 million years BP) and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9 million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.
After the evolution of Homo sapiens approximately 350,000 to 260,000 years BP in [Afri](1746)ca, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers. These first modern humans left [Afri](1746)ca and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of [Afri](1746)ca II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco, or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.
Other migrations of modern humans within the [Afri](1746)can continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern [Afri](1746)ca, Southeast [Afri](1746)ca, North [Afri](1746)ca, and the Sahara.

Emergence of civilization
The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions. At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its [Afri](1746)can populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia. However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5,000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification. The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern [Afri](1746)ca. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern [Afri](1746)ca and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.
The domestication of cattle in [Afri](1746)ca preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6,000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North [Afri](1746)ca. In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat that was common from [Algeria](1317) to Nubia. Between 10,000 and 9,000 BC, pottery was independently invented in the region of Mali in the savannah of West [Afri](1746)ca. In the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern West [Afri](1746)ca, people possibly ancestral to modern Nilo-Saharan and Mandé cultures started to collect wild millet, around 8,000 to 6,000 BC. Later, gourds, watermelons, castor beans, and cotton were also collected.: 64–75  Sorghum was first domesticated in Eastern Sudan around 4,000 BC, in one of the earliest instances of agriculture in human history. Its cultivation would gradually spread across [Afri](1746)ca, before spreading to India around 2000 BC.
People around modern-day Mauritania started making pottery and built stone settlements (e.g., Tichitt, Oualata). Fishing, using bone-tipped harpoons, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains. In West [Afri](1746)ca, the wet phase ushered in an expanding rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9,000 and 5,000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and raffia palm. Black-eyed peas and voandzeia ([Afri](1746)can groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.
Around 4,000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and encouraged migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West [Afri](1746)ca. During the first millennium BC, a reduction in wild grain populations related to changing climate conditions facilitated the expansion of farming communities and the rapid adoption of rice cultivation around the Niger River.
By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern [Afri](1746)ca. Around that time it also became established in parts of sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca, either through independent invention there or diffusion from the north and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, having lasted approximately 2,000 years, and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West [Afri](1746)ca. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West [Afri](1746)ca, although other regions did not begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North [Afri](1746)ca, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West [Afri](1746)ca, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.

4th millennium BC – 6th century AD
Northeast [Afri](1746)ca
From 3500 BC, nomes (ruled by nomarchs) coalesced to form the kingdoms of Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt in northeast [Afri](1746)ca. Around 3100 BC Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt to unify Egypt under the 1st dynasty, with the process of consolidation and assimilation completed by the time of the [3rd dynasty](1730) who formed the Old Kingdom of Egypt in 2686 BC.: 62–63  The Kingdom of Kerma emerged around this time to become the dominant force in Nubia, controlling territory as large as Egypt between the 1st and 4th cataracts of the Nile.
The 4th dynasty oversaw the height of the Old Kingdom, and constructed many great pyramids. Under the [6th dynasty](1732) power gradually decentralised to the nomarchs, culminating in the disintegration of the kingdom, exacerbated by drought and famine, thus commencing the First Intermediate Period in 2200 BC. This shattered state would last until 2055 BC when the [11th dynasty](1702), based in Thebes, conquered the others to form the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, with the [12th dynasty](1703) expanding into Lower Nubia at the expense of Kerma.: 68–71  In 1700 BC, the Middle Kingdom fractured in two, ushering in the Second Intermediate Period. The Hyksos, a militaristic people from Palestine, invaded and conquered Lower Egypt, while Kerma coordinated invasions deep into Egypt to reach its greatest extent.
In 1550 BC, the [18th dynasty](1704) expelled the Hyksos, and established the New Kingdom of Egypt. Using the advanced military technology the Hyksos had brought, the New Kingdom conquered the Levant from the Canaanites, Mittani, Amorites, and Hittites, and extinguished Kerma, incorporating Nubia into the empire, and sending the Egyptian empire into its golden age.: 73  Internal struggles, drought, famine, and invasions by a confederation of seafaring peoples contributed to the New Kingdom's collapse in 1069 BC, commencing the Third Intermediate Period.: 76–77 
Egypt's collapse liberated the more Egyptianised Kingdom of Kush in Nubia, who manoeuvred into power in Upper Egypt and conquered Lower Egypt in 754 BC to form the Kushite Empire. The Kushites ruled for a century and oversaw a revival in pyramid building, until they were driven out of Egypt by the Assyrians in 663 BC in reprisal for their expansion towards the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrians installed a puppet dynasty that later gained independence and once more unified Egypt, until they were conquered by the [Achaemenid Empire](1740) in 525 BC.: 77  Egypt regained independence under the 28th dynasty in 404 BC but they were reconquered by the Achaemenids in 343 BC. The conquest of [Achaemenid Egypt](1739) by Alexander the Great in 332 BC marked the beginning of Hellenistic rule and the installation of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.: 119 
The Ptolemaics lost their holdings outside of [Afri](1746)ca to the Seleucids in the Syrian Wars, expanded into Cyrenaica and subjugated Kush in the 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC, Ptolemaic Egypt became entangled in a Roman civil war, leading to its conquest by the Romans in 30 BC. The Crisis of the Third Century in the Roman Empire freed the Levantine city state of Palmyra, which conquered Egypt; their brief rule ended when they were reconquered by the Romans. In the midst of this, Kush regained independence from Egypt, and they would persist as a major regional power until, having been weakened from internal rebellion amid worsening climatic conditions, invasions by Aksum and the Noba caused their disintegration into Makuria, Alodia, and Nobatia in the 5th century AD. The Romans managed to hold on to Egypt for the rest of the ancient period.

Horn of [Afri](1746)ca
In the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca, there was the Land of Punt, a kingdom on the Red Sea, likely located in modern-day Eritrea or northern Somaliland. The [Ancient Egypt](138)ians initially traded via middle-men with Punt until in 2350 BC when they established direct relations. They would become close trading partners for over a millennium. Towards the end of the ancient period, northern Ethiopia and Eritrea bore the Kingdom of D'mt beginning in 980 BC. In modern-day Somalia and Djibouti there was the Macrobian Kingdom, with archaeological discoveries indicating the possibility of other unknown sophisticated civilisations at this time. After D'mt's fall in the 5th century BC the Ethiopian Plateau came to be ruled by numerous smaller unknown kingdoms who experienced strong south Arabian influence, until the growth and expansion of Aksum in the 1st century BC. Along the Horn's coast there were many ancient Somali city-states that thrived off of the wider Red Sea trade and transported their cargo via beden, exporting myrrh, frankincense, spices, gum, incense, and ivory, with freedom from Roman interference causing Indians to give the cities a lucrative monopoly on cinnamon from ancient India.
The Kingdom of Aksum grew from a principality into a major power on the trade route between Rome and India through conquering its unfortunately unknown neighbours, gaining a monopoly on Indian Ocean trade in the region. Aksum's rise had them rule over much of the regions from Lake Tana to the valley of the Nile, and they further conquered parts of the ailing Kingdom of Kush, led campaigns against the Noba and Beja peoples, and expanded into South Arabia. This led the Persian prophet Mani to consider Aksum as one of the four great powers of the 3rd century AD alongside Persia, Rome, and China. In the 4th century AD Aksum's king converted to Christianity and Aksum's population, who had followed syncretic mixes of local beliefs, slowly followed. The end of the 5th century saw Aksum allied with the Byzantine Empire, who viewed themselves as defenders of Christendom, balanced against the Sassanid Empire and the Himyarite Kingdom in Arabia.

Northwest [Afri](1746)ca
The Maghreb and Ifriqiya were mostly cut off from the cradle of civilisation in Egypt by the Libyan desert, exacerbated by Egyptian boats being tailored to the Nile and not coping well in the open Mediterranean Sea. This caused its societies to develop contiguous to those of Southern Europe, until Phoenician settlements came to dominate the most lucrative trading locations in the Gulf of Tunis.: 247  Phoenician settlements subsequently grew into Ancient Carthage after gaining independence from Phoenicia in the 6th century BC, and they would build an extensive empire and a strict mercantile network, all secured by one of the largest and most powerful navies in the ancient Mediterranean.: 251–253  Carthage would meet its demise in the Punic Wars against the expansionary Roman Republic, however momentum in these wars was not linear, with Carthage initially experiencing considerable success in the Second Punic War following Hannibal's infamous crossing of the alps into northern Italy.: 256–257  Their defeat and subsequent collapse of their empire would produce two further polities in the Maghreb; Numidia, which had assisted the Romans in the Second Punic War, Mauretania, a Mauri tribal kingdom and home of the legendary King Atlas, and various tribes such as Garamantes, Musulamii, and Bavares. The Third Punic War would result in Carthage's total defeat in 146 BC and the Romans established the province of [Afri](1746)ca, with Numidia assuming control of many of Carthage's [Afri](1746)can ports. Towards the end of the 2nd century BC Mauretania fought alongside Numidia's Jugurtha in the Jugurthine War against the Romans after he had usurped the Numidian throne from a Roman ally. Together they inflicted heavy casualties that quaked the Roman Senate, with the war only ending inconclusively when Mauretania's Bocchus I sold out Jugurtha to the Romans.: 258 
At the turn of the millennium, they both would face the same fate as Carthage and be conquered by the Romans who established Mauretania and Numidia as provinces of their empire, while Musulamii, led by Tacfarinas, and Garamantes were eventually defeated in war in the 1st century AD however weren't conquered.: 261–262  In the 5th century AD the Vandals conquered north [Afri](1746)ca precipitating the fall of Rome. Swathes of indigenous peoples would regain self-governance in the Mauro-Roman Kingdom and its numerous successor polities in the Maghreb, namely the kingdoms of Ouarsenis, Aurès, and Altava. The Vandals ruled Ifriqiya for a century until Byzantine reconquest in the early 6th century AD. The Byzantines and the Berber kingdoms fought minor inconsequential conflicts, such as in the case of Garmul, however largely coexisted.: 284  Further inland to the Byzantine Exarchate of [Afri](1746)ca were the Sanhaja in modern-day [Algeria](1317), a broad grouping of three groupings of tribal confederations, one of which is the Masmuda grouping in modern-day Morocco, along with the nomadic Zenata; their composite tribes would later go onto shape much of North [Afri](1746)can history.

West [Afri](1746)ca
In the western Sahel the rise of settled communities occurred largely as a result of the domestication of millet and of sorghum. Archaeology points to sizable urban populations in West [Afri](1746)ca beginning in the 4th millennium BC, which had crucially developed iron metallurgy by 1200 BC, in both smelting and forging for tools and weapons. Extensive east-west belts of deserts, grasslands, and forests from north to south were crucial for the moulding of their respective societies and meant that prior to the accession of trans-Saharan trade routes, symbiotic trade relations developed in response to the opportunities afforded by north–south diversity in ecosystems. Various civilisations prospered in this period. From 4000 BC, the Tichitt culture in modern-day Mauritania and Mali was the oldest known complexly organised society in West [Afri](1746)ca, with a four tiered hierarchical social structure. Other civilisations include the Kintampo culture from 2500 BC in modern-day Ghana, the Nok culture from 1500 BC in modern-day Nigeria, the Daima culture around Lake Chad from 550 BC, Djenné-Djenno from 250 BC in modern-day Mali, and the Serer civilisation in modern-day Senegal, which built the Senegambian stone circles from the 3rd century BC. There is also detailed record of Igodomigodo, a small kingdom founded presumably in 40 BC, which would later go on to form the Benin Empire.
Towards the end of the 3rd century AD, a wet period in the Sahel created areas for human habitation and exploitation that had not been habitable for the best part of a millennium, with the Kingdom of Wagadu, the local name of the Ghana Empire, rising out of the Tichitt culture, growing wealthy following the introduction of the camel to the western Sahel, revolutionising the trans-Saharan trade that linked their capital and Aoudaghost with Tahert and Sijilmasa in North [Afri](1746)ca. Soninke traditions likely contain content from prehistory, mentioning four previous foundings of Wagadu, and holds that the final founding of Wagadu occurred after their first king did a deal with Bida, a serpent deity who was guarding a well, to sacrifice one maiden a year in exchange for assurance regarding plenty of rainfall and gold supply. Wagadu's core traversed modern-day southern Mauritania and western Mali, and Soninke tradition portrays early Ghana as warlike, with horse-mounted warriors key to increasing its territory and population, although details of their expansion are extremely scarce. Wagadu made its profits from maintaining a monopoly on gold heading north and salt heading south, despite not controlling the gold fields themselves, located in the forest regions. It is probable that Wagadu's dominance on trade allowed for the gradual consolidation of many polities into a confederated state, whose composites stood in varying relations to the core, from fully administered to nominal tribute-paying parity. Based on large tumuli scattered across West [Afri](1746)ca dating to this period, it has been stipulated that relative to Wagadu, there were further simultaneous and preceding kingdoms that have unfortunately been lost to time.

Central, Eastern, and Southern [Afri](1746)ca
At the 4th millennium BC the Congo Basin was inhabited by the Bambenga, Bayaka, Bakoya, and Babongo in the west, the Bambuti in the east, and the Batwa who were widely scattered and also present in the Great Lakes region; together they are grouped as Pygmies. On the later-named Swahili coast there were Cushitic-speaking peoples, and the Khoisan (a neologism for the Khoekhoe and San) in the continent's south.
The Bantu expansion constituted a major series of migrations of Bantu peoples from central [Afri](1746)ca to eastern and southern [Afri](1746)ca and was substantial in the settling of the continent. Commencing in the 2nd millennium BC, the Bantu began to migrate from Cameroon to central, eastern, and southern [Afri](1746)ca, laying the foundations for future states such as the Kingdom of Kongo in the Congo Basin, the Empire of Kitara in the [Afri](1746)can Great Lakes, the Luba Empire in the Upemba Depression, the Kilwa Sultanate in the Swahili coast by crowding out Azania, with Rhapta being its last stronghold by the 1st century AD, and forming various city states constituting the Swahili civilisation. These migrations also prefaced the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the Zambezi basin. After reaching the Zambezi, the Bantu continued southward, with eastern groups continuing to modern-day Mozambique and reaching Maputo in the 2nd century AD. Further to the south, settlements of Bantu peoples who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen were well established south of the Limpopo River by the 4th century AD, displacing and absorbing the Khoisan.
By the Chari River south of Lake Chad the Sao civilisation flourished for over a millennium beginning in the 6th century BC, in territory that later became part of present-day Cameroon and Chad. Sao artifacts show that they were skilled workers in bronze, copper, and iron,: 19  with finds including bronze sculptures, terracotta statues of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewellery, highly decorated pottery, and spears.: 19 : 1051  Nearby, around Lake Ejagham in south-west Cameroon, the Ekoi civilisation rose circa 2nd century AD, and are most notable for constructing the Ikom monoliths and developing the Nsibidi script.

9th to 18th centuries
Pre-colonial [Afri](1746)ca possessed as many as 10,000 different states and polities. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern [Afri](1746)ca; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu peoples of central, southern, and eastern [Afri](1746)ca; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms, such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West [Afri](1746)ca; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast [Afri](1746)ca.
By the 9th century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire, which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.
In the forested regions of the West [Afri](1746)can coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri, which was ruled by the Eze Nri, was established around the ninth century, making it one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu.

The Kingdom of Ife, historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba ('king' or 'ruler' in the Yoruba language), called the Ooni of Ife. Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West [Afri](1746)ca and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted by the Oyo Empire, whose obas, called the Alaafins of Oyo, controlled many other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms including the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey.
The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over northwestern [Afri](1746)ca and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century. The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized, and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.
Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic [Afri](1746)can Muslim scholarship. By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, Jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.

Height of the slave trade
Slavery had long been practiced in [Afri](1746)ca. Between the 15th and the 19th centuries, the [Atlantic slave trade](1583) took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World. In addition, more than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North [Afri](1746)ca between the 16th and 19th centuries.
In West [Afri](1746)ca, the decline of the [Atlantic slave trade](1583) in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West [Afri](1746)can coast, obliged [Afri](1746)can states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West [Afri](1746)ca Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 [Afri](1746)cans who were aboard.
Action was also taken against [Afri](1746)can leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 [Afri](1746)can rulers. The largest powers of West [Afri](1746)ca (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of "legitimate commerce" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West [Afri](1746)ca's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.

Colonialism
Independence struggles
Imperial rule by Europeans continued until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in [Afri](1746)ca gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957), becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Over the next decade, waves of decolonization took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 Year of [Afri](1746)ca and the establishment of the Organisation of [Afri](1746)can Unity in 1963.
Portugal's overseas presence in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South [Afri](1746)ca was one of the first [Afri](1746)can countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority, initially through qualified voting rights and from 1956 by a system of racial segregation known as apartheid, until 1994.

Post-colonial [Afri](1746)ca
Today, [Afri](1746)ca contains 54 sovereign countries.  Since independence, [Afri](1746)can states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of [Afri](1746)can states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis—per the criteria laid out by Lührmann et al. (2018), only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most [Afri](1746)can countries have experienced several coups or periods of military dictatorship. Between 1990 and 2018, though, the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance.
Upon independence an overwhelming majority of [Afri](1746)cans lived in extreme poverty. The continent suffered from the lack of infrastructural or industrial development under colonial rule, along with political instability. With limited financial resources or access to global markets, relatively stable countries such as Kenya still experienced only very slow economic development. Only a handful of [Afri](1746)can countries succeeded in obtaining rapid economic growth prior to 1990. Exceptions include Libya and Equatorial Guinea, both of which possess large oil reserves.
Instability throughout the continent after decolonization resulted primarily from marginalization of ethnic groups, and corruption. In pursuit of personal political gain, many leaders deliberately promoted ethnic conflicts, some of which had originated during the colonial period, such as from the grouping of multiple unrelated ethnic groups into a single colony, the splitting of a distinct ethnic group between multiple colonies, or existing conflicts being exacerbated by colonial rule (for instance, the preferential treatment given to ethnic Hutus over Tutsis in Rwanda during German and Belgian rule).
Faced with increasingly frequent and severe violence, military rule was widely accepted by the population of many countries as means to maintain order, and during the 1970s and 1980s a majority of [Afri](1746)can countries were controlled by military dictatorships. Territorial disputes between nations and rebellions by groups seeking independence were also common in independent [Afri](1746)can states. The most devastating of these was the Nigerian Civil War, fought between government forces and an Igbo separatist republic, which resulted in a famine that killed 1–2 million people. Two civil wars in Sudan, the first lasting from 1955 to 1972 and the second from 1983 to 2005, collectively killed around 3 million. Both were fought primarily on ethnic and religious lines.
Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also contributed to instability. Both the Soviet Union and the United States offered considerable incentives to [Afri](1746)can political and military leaders who aligned themselves with the superpowers' foreign policy. As an example, during the Angolan Civil War, the Soviet and Cuban aligned MPLA and the American aligned UNITA received the vast majority of their military and political support from these countries. Many [Afri](1746)can countries became highly dependent on foreign aid. The sudden loss of both Soviet and American aid at the end of the Cold War and fall of the USSR resulted in severe economic and political turmoil in the countries most dependent on foreign support.
There was a major famine in Ethiopia between 1983 and 1985, killing up to 1.2 million people, which most historians attribute primarily to the forced relocation of farmworkers and seizure of grain by communist Derg government, further exacerbated by the civil war. In 1994 a genocide in Rwanda resulted in up to 800,000 deaths, added to a severe refugee crisis and fueled the rise of militia groups in neighboring countries. This contributed to the outbreak of the first and second Congo Wars, which were the most devastating military conflicts in modern [Afri](1746)ca, with up to 5.5 million deaths, making it by far the deadliest conflict in modern [Afri](1746)can history and one of the costliest wars in human history.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

Various conflicts between various insurgent groups and governments continue. Since 2003, there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur (Sudan), which peaked in intensity from 2003 to 2005 with notable spikes in violence in 2007 and 2013–15, killing around 300,000 people total. The Boko Haram Insurgency primarily within Nigeria (with considerable fighting in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon as well) has killed around 350,000 people since 2009. Most [Afri](1746)can conflicts have been reduced to low-intensity conflicts as of 2022. However, the Tigray War from 2020 to 2022 killed an estimated 300,000–500,000 people, primarily due to famine.
Overall though, violence across [Afri](1746)ca has greatly declined in the 21st century, with the end of civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and [Algeria](1317) in 2002, Liberia in 2003, and Sudan and Burundi in 2005. The Second Congo War, which involved 9 countries and several insurgent groups, ended in 2003. This decline in violence coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms, which over the course of the 1990s and 2000s promoted the establishment of permanent, peaceful trade between neighboring countries (see Capitalist peace).
Improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many [Afri](1746)can nations, mainly from China, which further spurred economic growth. Between 2000 and 2014, annual GDP growth in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca averaged 5.02%, doubling its total GDP from $811 billion to $1.63 trillion (constant 2015 USD). North [Afri](1746)ca experienced comparable growth rates. A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone. While several individual countries have maintained high growth rates, since 2014 overall growth has considerably slowed, primarily as a result of falling commodity prices, continued lack of industrialization, and epidemics of Ebola and COVID-19.

Geology, geography, ecology, and environment
[Afri](1746)ca is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 163 km (101 mi) wide. Geopolitically, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of [Afri](1746)ca as well.

The coastline is 26,000 km (16,000 mi) long, and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe, which covers only 10,400,000 km2 (4,000,000 sq mi) – about a third of the surface of [Afri](1746)ca – has a coastline of 32,000 km (20,000 mi). From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia (37°21' N), to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South [Afri](1746)ca (34°51'15" S), is a distance of approximately 8,000 km (5,000 mi). Cape Verde, 17°33'22" W, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,400 km (4,600 mi) to Ras Hafun, 51°27'52" E, the most easterly projection that neighbours Cape Guardafui, the tip of the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca.
[Afri](1746)ca's largest country is [Algeria](1317), and its smallest country is Seychelles, an archipelago off the east coast. The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia.

[Afri](1746)can plate
Climate
The climate of [Afri](1746)ca ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily desert, or arid, while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and dense jungle (rainforest) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. [Afri](1746)ca is the hottest continent on Earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts. The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58 °C (136 °F)), was discredited in 2013.

Climate change
Ecology and biodiversity
[Afri](1746)ca has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing [Afri](1746)ca's biological diversity and arable land. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in [Afri](1746)ca. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.
Deforestation is affecting [Afri](1746)ca at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). According to the University of Pennsylvania [Afri](1746)can Studies Center, 31% of [Afri](1746)ca's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and [Afri](1746)ca is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world. Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West [Afri](1746)ca have been destroyed. Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago. About 65% of [Afri](1746)ca's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.

Fauna
[Afri](1746)ca boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians. In addition, [Afri](1746)ca has the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna.

Environmental issues
Infrastructure
Water resources
Water development and management are complex in [Afri](1746)ca due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers). Around 75% of sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca falls within 53 international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders. This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area's water resources. A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments. A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern [Afri](1746)can Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission. However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.

Politics
[Afri](1746)can Union
The [Afri](1746)can Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of 55 member states. The union was formed, with [Addis Ababa](1742), Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002 as a successor to the Organisation of [Afri](1746)can Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the [Afri](1746)can Union's Pan-[Afri](1746)can Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South [Afri](1746)ca, but the [Afri](1746)can Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in [Addis Ababa](1742).
The [Afri](1746)can Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the [Afri](1746)can Union, which aims to transform the [Afri](1746)can Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The [Afri](1746)can Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [Afri](1746)can Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the [Afri](1746)can Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-[Afri](1746)can Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the [Afri](1746)can Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-[Afri](1746)can Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by [Afri](1746)can treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union, regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.
Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of [Afri](1746)ca, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Ivory Coast.

Boundary conflicts
Economy
Although it has abundant natural resources, [Afri](1746)ca remains the world's poorest and least-developed continent (other than [Antarctica](153)), the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, low self-esteem, lack of access to foreign capital, legacies of colonialism, the slave trade, and the Cold War, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide). Its total nominal GDP remains behind that of the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, India and France. According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all [Afri](1746)can.
Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, inadequate water supply and sanitation, and poor health affect a large proportion of the people who reside on the [Afri](1746)can continent. In August 2008, the World Bank announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). Eighty-one percent of the sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)can population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 86% for India.
Sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973, indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.
[Afri](1746)ca is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)can countries. The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC). The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in [Afri](1746)ca. About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca was resolved, Zambia fell back into debt. A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.
From 1995 to 2005, [Afri](1746)ca's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity.
In a recently published analysis based on World Values Survey data, the Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch maintained that several [Afri](1746)can countries, most notably Ghana, perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy. The following table is projection(s) as of 2024 in terms of the peak level of GDP (nominal) and (Purchasing Power Parity) by the IMF and the World Bank.

Tausch's global value comparison based on the World Values Survey derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of [Afri](1746)can countries with complete data, Tausch concluded "is really amazing". While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in Ghana, the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for Egypt and [Algeria](1317), and especially for [Afri](1746)ca's leading economy, South [Afri](1746)ca. High human inequality, as measured by the UNDP's Human Development Report's Index of Human Inequality, impairs the development of human security. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and human rights data, emerging from [Afri](1746)ca, is reflected in the development of a civil society.
The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite, 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite. As the growth in [Afri](1746)ca has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008, which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis, pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.
In recent years, the China has built increasingly stronger ties with [Afri](1746)can nations and is [Afri](1746)ca's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in [Afri](1746)ca.
A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that [Afri](1746)ca could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "[Afri](1746)can agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured [Afri](1746)ca's export of raw materials and importation of food. [Afri](1746)ca is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."

Electricity generation
The main source of electricity is hydropower, which contributes significantly to the current installed capacity for energy. The Kainji Dam is a typical hydropower resource generating electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria as well as their neighbouring country, Niger. Hence, the continuous investment in the last decade, which has increased the amount of power generated.

Demographics
[Afri](1746)ca's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and is consequently relatively young. In some [Afri](1746)can states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age. The total number of people in [Afri](1746)ca increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990. As of 2021, the population of [Afri](1746)ca is estimated at 1.4 billion. [Afri](1746)ca's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; [Afri](1746)can population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000. This increase in number of babies born in [Afri](1746)ca compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050; while in 1990 sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca accounted for only 16% of the world's births.
The total fertility rate (children per woman) for Sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world. All countries in sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca had TFRs (average number of children) above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of global livebirths. In 2021, sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca accounted for 29% of global births.
Speakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast [Afri](1746)ca. The Bantu-speaking peoples from the Sahel progressively expanded over most of sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca. But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East [Afri](1746)ca, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan ("San" or "Bushmen") and Pygmy peoples in Southern and Central [Afri](1746)ca, respectively. Bantu-speaking [Afri](1746)cans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern [Afri](1746)ca, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "Hottentots") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other [Afri](1746)cans and are the indigenous people of southern [Afri](1746)ca. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central [Afri](1746)ca.
The peoples of West [Afri](1746)ca primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and [Afro-Asiatic](1789) speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan, and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West [Afri](1746)ca bordering Central [Afri](1746)ca.

The peoples of North [Afri](1746)ca consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North [Afri](1746)ca. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo-European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North [Afri](1746)ca as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and [Algeria](1317) in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya. The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North [Afri](1746)ca. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of [Afro-Asiatic](1789)-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.
In the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the [Afro-Asiatic](1789) language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of [Afro-Asiatic](1789).
Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of [Afri](1746)ca. Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers—especially from [Algeria](1317) and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North [Afri](1746)ca), Kenya, Congo, Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola. Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone. Nevertheless, white [Afri](1746)cans remain an important minority in many [Afri](1746)can states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and South [Afri](1746)ca. The country with the largest white [Afri](1746)can population is South [Afri](1746)ca. Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.
European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South [Afri](1746)ca, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast [Afri](1746)can countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with [Afri](1746)cans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South [Afri](1746)ca as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East [Afri](1746)ca, respectively.

Religion
While [Afri](1746)cans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, the majority of the people respect [Afri](1746)can religions or parts of them. However, in formal surveys or census, most people will identify with major religions that came from outside the continent, mainly through colonisation. There are several reasons for this, the main one being the colonial idea that [Afri](1746)can religious beliefs and practices are not good enough. Religious beliefs and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations. According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Islam and Christianity are the two largest religions in [Afri](1746)ca. Islam is most prevalent in Northern [Afri](1746)ca, and is the state religion of many North [Afri](1746)can countries, such as [Algeria](1317), where 99% of the population practices Islam. The majority of people in most governments in Southern, Southeast, and Central [Afri](1746)ca, as well as in a sizable portion of the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca and West [Afri](1746)ca, identify as Christians. The Coptic Christians constitute a sizable minority in Egypt, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is the largest church in Ethiopia, with 36 million and 51 million adherents. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of [Afri](1746)cans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baháʼí, or Jewish. There is also a minority of people in [Afri](1746)ca who are irreligious.

Languages
By most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in [Afri](1746)ca. Most are of [Afri](1746)can origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. [Afri](1746)ca is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple [Afri](1746)can languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major groups indigenous to [Afri](1746)ca:

The [Afroasiatic languages](1791) are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of [Afri](1746)ca, North [Afri](1746)ca, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.
The Nilo-Saharan languages consist of a group of several possibly related families, spoken by 30 million people between 100 languages. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.
The Niger-Congo language family covers much of sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in [Afri](1746)ca and perhaps one of the largest in the world.
The Khoisan languages form a group of three unrelated families and two isolates and number about fifty in total. They are mainly spoken in Southern [Afri](1746)ca by approximately 400,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of [Afri](1746)ca.
Following the end of colonialism, nearly all [Afri](1746)can countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see [Afri](1746)can French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, [Afri](1746)kaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of [Afri](1746)ca, and that are used by millions of [Afri](1746)cans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in [Afri](1746)ca. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate. In total, at least a fifth of [Afri](1746)cans speak the former colonial languages.

Health
More than 85% of individuals in [Afri](1746)ca use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The Organization of [Afri](1746)can Unity (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the [Afri](1746)can Decade on [Afri](1746)can traditional medicine in an effort to promote The WHO [Afri](1746)can Region's adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent. Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca.
AIDS in post-colonial [Afri](1746)ca is a prevalent issue. Although the continent is home to about 15.2 percent of the world's population, more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide—some 35 million people—were [Afri](1746)cans, of whom 15 million have already died. Sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca alone accounted for an estimated 69 percent of all people living with HIV and 70 percent of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the countries of sub-Saharan [Afri](1746)ca most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years. Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of [Afri](1746)ca has declined, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.

Culture
Some aspects of traditional [Afri](1746)can cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, [Afri](1746)can customs were discouraged, and [Afri](1746)can languages were prohibited in mission schools. Leopold II of [Belgium](197) attempted to "civilize" [Afri](1746)cans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.
Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern [Afri](1746)can art. According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, "The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art." Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects "lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions." Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that "the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign [Afri](1746)ca and modernist art." Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of [Afri](1746)can literature had its genesis in the "traumatic encounter between [Afri](1746)ca and Europe." On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that [Afri](1746)cans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)assert themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.
There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue [Afri](1746)can traditional cultures, under such movements as the [Afri](1746)can Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, [Afrocentrism](1793), led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.
As of March 2023, 98 [Afri](1746)can properties are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Among these proprieties, 54 are cultural sites, 39 are natural sites and 5 are mixed sites. The List Of World Heritage in Danger includes 15 [Afri](1746)can sites.

Sports
Fifty-four [Afri](1746)can countries have football teams in the Confederation of [Afri](1746)can Football. Egypt has won the [Afri](1746)can Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Ghana, and [Algeria](1317) have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. Morocco, at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was the first [Afri](1746)can nation to reach the semi-finals of the FIFA Men's World Cup. South [Afri](1746)ca hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first [Afri](1746)can country to do so. The top clubs in each [Afri](1746)can football league play the CAF Champions League, while lower-ranked clubs compete in CAF Confederation Cup.
In recent years, the continent has progressed in terms of state-of-the-art basketball facilities, which have been built in cities such as Cairo, Dakar, Johannesburg, Kigali, Luanda and Rades. The number of [Afri](1746)can basketball players who drafted into the U.S. NBA has experienced growth in the 2010s.
[Cricket](1466) is popular in some [Afri](1746)can nations. South [Afri](1746)ca and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the [2003 [Cricket](1466) World Cup](1707). Namibia is the other [Afri](1746)can country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco, in northern [Afri](1746)ca, hosted the [2002 Morocco Cup](1706), but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament.
Rugby is popular in several southern [Afri](1746)can nations. Namibia and Zimbabwe have appeared on multiple occasions at the Rugby World Cup, while South [Afri](1746)ca is the most successful national team at the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament on four occasions, in 1995, 2007, 2019, and 2023.
Traditional sports were strictly marginalised during the colonial era, and many are dying or have gone extinct under the pressure of modernisation, however lots remain popular despite not having formal governmental recognition or support.: 193–194  Some examples are Senegalese wrestling, Dambe, Nguni stick-fighting, and Savika.
