Ashgate Publishing
Ashgate Publishing was an academic book and journal publisher based in Farnham (Surrey, United Kingdom). It was established in 1967 and specialised in the social sciences, arts, humanities and professional practice. It had an American office in Burlington, Vermont, and another British office in London. It is now a subsidiary of Informa (Taylor & Francis).
The company had several imprints including Gower Publishing which published professional business and management titles; Lund Humphries, originally established in 1939, which published illustrated art books, particularly in the field of modern British art; and Dartmouth. In March 2015, Gower unveiled GpmFirst, a web-based community of practice allowing subscribers access to more than 120 project management titles, as well as discussions and articles relevant to business and project management.
In July 2015, it was announced that Ashgate had been sold to Informa for a reported Â£20M, and Lund Humphries was relaunched, as an independent publisher in December 2015. By February 2016, the independent imprints of Ashgate became part of the Routledge imprint.
