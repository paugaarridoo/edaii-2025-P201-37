3887
Caesareum of Alexandria
The Caesareum of [Alexandria](1844) is an ancient temple in [Alexandria](1844), [Egypt](1987). It was conceived by Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic kingdom, the last pharaoh of [Ancient [Egypt](1987)](138), to honour her first known lover Julius Caesar or Mark Antony.
The edifice was finished by the Roman emperor [Augustus](2924), after he defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in [Egypt](1987). He destroyed all traces of Antony in [Alexandria](1844), and apparently dedicated the temple to his own cult.
Converted to a Christian church in the late 4th century, the Caesareum was the headquarters of Cyril of [Alexandria](1844), the Patriarch of [Alexandria](1844) from 412 to 444.
The philosopher and mathematician [Hypatia](3801) was murdered at the Caesareum by a Christian mob in 415; they stripped her naked and tore her to pieces.
Elements of the temple survived until the 19th century. Cleopatra's Needles, two much earlier obelisks moved to the temple in ancient times, now stand in [Central Park](2216) in New York City and on the Thames Embankment, in [London](2275). The underwater archaeological work of Franck Goddio and the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM) in the eastern harbour of [Alexandria](1844) has added to the knowledge about the Caesareum. An article "The Caesarium", published in 2021, reveals that the groundworks were started prior to the reign of Cleopatra VII. It also considers the building's relationship with the harbour based on ancient texts and the position of Cleopatra's Needles and it provides some indications about the siting of the temple itself.
Today, a large statue of the Alexandrine nationalist leader Saad Zaghloul (1859â€“1927) stands on the Caesareum site.
