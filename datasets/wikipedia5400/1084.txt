Bids
As per the agreement between the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee in 2001, a city which wins the Olympic Games host bid will also stage the Paralympic Games.

Development and preparation
Brisbane Organising Committee for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games was established by the Queensland Government to plan, organise and deliver the Olympic and Paralympic Games in accordance with the host contract".

Transportation
In November 2022, advocates including Paralympian Karni Liddell raised concerns about Brisbane's preparedness to host the Paralympics in 2032, citing many instances where there was a lack of appropriate accessibility for people with disabilities throughout the city. Liddell implored Games organisers to consult the disability sector to enable the city to become fully accessible to those disabilities. Youngcare Connect manager Shane Jamieson also accused the city of being "completely ill-prepared" to host the Paralympics, stating that future development prior to 2032 would rely on consultation with people with disabilities. Queensland Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said that Queensland was still lagging behind in relation to making public transport fully accessible to those with a disability, with 40% of railway stations in South East Queensland still only accessible by stairs.

The Games
New sports
In 2021, International Rugby League (IRL) declared an intent to campaign for the inclusion of rugby league in the [2032 Summer Olympics](1083) and Paralympics, focusing on wheelchair rugby league for the Paralympics and league nines for the Olympics.
