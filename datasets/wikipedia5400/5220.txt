Afrikaner-Jews
Afrikaner-Jews ([Afrikaans](1787): Afrikaner-Jode, also called Boerejode) are Jewish Afrikaners. At the beginning of the 19th century, when greater freedom of religious practice was permitted in South Africa, small numbers of [Ashkenazi Jews](3098) arrived from Britain and Germany. They established the first Ashkenazi Hebrew congregation in 1841. Between the end of the 19th century and 1930, large numbers of Jews began to arrive from Lithuania and Latvia. Their culture and contribution changed the character of the South African community.
