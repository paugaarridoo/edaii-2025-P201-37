BBC Two
[BBC](2927) Two is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the [BBC](2927). It is the corporation's second flagship channel, and it covers a wide range of subject matter, incorporating genres such as comedy, drama and documentaries. [BBC](2927) Two has a remit "to broadcast programmes of depth and substance" in contrast to the more mainstream and popular [BBC](2927) One.
Like the [BBC](2927)'s other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the television licence, and is therefore free of commercial advertising. It is a comparatively well-funded public-service channel, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public-service channels worldwide.
Originally styled [BBC](2927)2, it was the third British television station to be launched (starting on 21 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on [BBC](2927) Two, for example the [BBC](2927) Proms, now tend to appear on [BBC](2927) Four instead.

History
Launch
British television at the time of [BBC](2927)2's launch consisted of two channels: the [BBC](2927) Television Service and the ITV network made up of smaller regional companies. Both channels had existed in a state of competition since ITV's launch in 1955, and both had aimed for a populist approach in response. The 1962 Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting noticed this, and that ITV lacked any culturally relevant programming. It therefore decided that Britain's third television station should be awarded to the [BBC](2927).
Prior to its launch, the new [BBC](2927)2 was promoted on the [BBC](2927) Television Service: the soon-to-be-renamed [BBC](2927)1. The animated adverts featured the campaign mascots "Hullabaloo", a mother kangaroo, and "Custard", her joey. Prior to, and several years after, the channel's formal launch, the channel broadcast "Trade Test Transmissions", short films made externally by companies such as Shell and BP, which served to enable engineers to test reception, but became cult viewing.
The channel was scheduled to begin at 19:20 on 20 April 1964, showing an evening of light entertainment, starting with the comedy show The Alberts, a performance from Soviet comedian Arkady Raikin, and a production of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate, culminating with a fireworks display. However, at around 18:45 a huge power failure, originating from a fire at Battersea Power Station, caused Television Centre, and indeed much of west London, to lose all power. [BBC](2927)1 was able to continue broadcasting via its facilities at Alexandra Palace, but all attempts to show the scheduled programmes on the new channel failed. Associated-Rediffusion, the London weekday ITV franchise-holder, offered to transmit on the [BBC](2927)'s behalf, but their gesture was rejected. At 22:00 programming was officially postponed until the following morning. As the [BBC](2927)'s news centre at Alexandra Palace was unaffected, they did in fact broadcast brief bulletins on [BBC](2927)2 that evening, beginning with an announcement by the newsreader Gerald Priestland at around 19:25. There was believed to be no recording made of this bulletin, but a videotape was discovered in early 2003.
By 11:00 on 21 April 1964, power had been restored to the studios and programming began, thus making Play School the first programme to be shown officially on the channel. The launch schedule, postponed from the night before, was then successfully shown that evening, albeit with minor changes. In reference to the power cut, the transmission opened with a shot of a lit candle which was then sarcastically blown out by presenter Denis Tuohy.
To establish the new channel's identity and draw viewers to it, the [BBC](2927) decided that a widely promoted, lavish series would be essential in its earliest days. The production chosen was The Forsyte Saga (1967), a no-expense-spared adaptation of the novels by John Galsworthy, featuring well-established actors Kenneth More and Eric Porter. Critically for the future of the fledgling channel, the [BBC](2927)'s gamble was hugely successful, with an average of six million viewers per episode: a feat made more prominent by the fact that only 9 million were able to receive the channel at the time. In 1974, [BBC](2927)2's widely acclaimed singer-songwriter series, In Concert, was lauded by The Guardian as the only British music television program that "produced television ideas".

Technological advancements
Unlike [BBC](2927)1 and ITV, [BBC](2927)2 was broadcast only on the 625-line UHF system, so was not available to viewers still using sets only capable of receiving the 405-line VHF system. This created a market for dual standard receivers which could switch between the two systems. Set manufacturers increased production of UHF sets in anticipation of a large market demand for the new [BBC](2927)2, but the market did not materialise..
The early technical problems, which included being unable to transmit US-recorded videotapes due to a lack of system conversion from the US NTSC system, were resolved by a committee headed by James Redmond, although this problem was not unique to [BBC](2927)2.
On 1 July 1967, during the Wimbledon Championships, [BBC](2927)2 became the first channel in Europe to begin regular broadcasts in colour, using the PAL system. The thirteen-part series Civilisation (1969) was created as a celebration of two millennia of western art and culture to showpiece the new colour technology. [BBC](2927)1 and ITV later joined [BBC](2927)2 on 625-line UHF band but continued to simulcast on 405-line VHF until 1985. [BBC](2927)1 and ITV simultaneously introduced PAL colour on UHF on 15 November 1969, although they both had broadcast some programmes in colour "unofficially" since September 1969.
In 1979, the station's adoption of the first computer-generated channel identification (ident) in Britain, with its use of the double striped, orange '2' logo, heralded the start of computer-generated logos. The ident, created in-house by [BBC](2927) engineers, lasted until March 1986. 
As the switch to digital-only terrestrial transmission progressed, [BBC](2927) Two was (in each region in turn) the first analogue TV channel to be replaced with the [BBC](2927) multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current Freeview service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for [BBC](2927) Two to end on analogue terrestrial television was Northern Ireland on 10 October 2012.
At the 2012 Edinburgh International Television Festival, [BBC](2927) Two was named "Terrestrial Channel of the Year".
A high-definition simulcast of [BBC](2927) Two began broadcasting on 26 March 2013, replacing the standalone [BBC](2927) HD channel. As of 29 November 2018, there are three variations of [BBC](2927) Two HD (Wales, Northern Ireland, and England).

Operation
The channel controllers have been:

1964–1965: Michael Peacock
1965–1969: David Attenborough
1969–1974: Robin Scott
1974–1978: Aubrey Singer
1978–1982: Brian Wenham
1982–1987: Graeme MacDonald
1987–1992: Alan Yentob
1992–1996: Michael Jackson
1996–1999: Mark Thompson
1999–2004: Jane Root
2004–2008: Roly Keating
2008–2014: Janice Hadlow
2014: Adam Barker (acting)
2014–2016: Kim Shillinglaw
2016–2022: Patrick Holland
Adam Barker served as Acting Controller of the channel after Janice Hadlow left the channel in March 2014 and until Kim Shillinglaw began as the new permanent occupant of the post.
From 2013, the Controller of [BBC](2927) Two was given the expanded title Controller of [BBC](2927) Two and [BBC](2927) Four, with ultimate oversight of the [BBC](2927) Four service added to their duties (a [BBC](2927) Four "Channel Editor", reporting up to this Controller, was allocated day-to-day operational control of Four).
The channel forms part of the [BBC](2927) Television executive group and is answerable to the head of that department, and to the [BBC](2927) Board.
On 20 January 2016, Kim Shillinglaw announced that she had decided to leave the [BBC](2927) as the Controller of [BBC](2927) Two & [BBC](2927) Four; as a result of the reorganisation, the posts of Controller of [BBC](2927) Two and [BBC](2927) Four were closed.
Patrick Holland became Channel Controller of [BBC](2927) Two in March 2017, following his earlier appointment as Channel Editor in July 2016.

Programming
[BBC](2927) Two's remit is to be a mixed-genre channel appealing to a broad adult audience with programmes of depth and substance. It should carry the greatest amount and range of knowledge building programming of any [BBC](2927) television channel, complemented by distinctive comedy, drama and arts programming.
[BBC](2927) Two's historical scope was arts, culture, some comedy and drama, and appealing to audiences not already served by [BBC](2927) One or ITV. Over its first thirty or so years the channel developed a reputation for screening highly praised and prestigious drama series, among these Boys from the Blackstuff (1982), 1991's highly successful The Men's Room, the costume drama Middlemarch (1994) or 1996's critically acclaimed Our Friends in the North. The channel's "highbrow" profile is also in part attributable to a long history of demanding documentaries of all types, beginning with Civilisation and The Ascent of Man in the 1960s. Like the early Channel 4, [BBC](2927) Two also established for itself a reputation as a champion of independent and international cinema, under the Screen 2 brand.
The channel has sometimes been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and closer to the mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only [BBC](2927) Four, the [BBC](2927) has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, until the end of the UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012, a minority (7.5% in the final quarter of 2010) of viewers did not receive. [BBC](2927) Four's remit is very similar to the earlier remit of [BBC](2927)2, and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow [BBC](2927) Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings. Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of [BBC](2927) Two's earlier output with the arts strand The Culture Show. Its most popular programme at the moment is Top Gear, which now moved to [BBC](2927) One.
Much of [BBC](2927) Two's output has previously or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from [BBC](2927) Four in a late-night strand, originally called [BBC](2927) Four on Two but now unbranded. Other programmes are moved to the channel as a result of their success on [BBC](2927) Three or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the [BBC](2927) Three series Torchwood, which was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. [BBC](2927) Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship [BBC](2927) One: such examples include Have I Got News for You and popular comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Miranda, which moved to [BBC](2927) One after success on Two. Also in August 2014, The Great British Bake Off moved to [BBC](2927) One, due to its success the previous year on [BBC](2927) Two. In 2017, Bake Off moved from [BBC](2927) One to Channel 4.
Another founding part of [BBC](2927) Two was to provide educational and community programming on the [BBC](2927), as part of its public service remit. The educational section of this commitment saw [BBC](2927)2 broadcast a large amount of programming for the Open University, who co-produced programming with the corporation, and saw the channel broadcast [BBC](2927) Schools programmes from 1983 until the programmes were transferred to the [BBC](2927) Learning Zone in 2010.
As a result of the channel's commitment to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic Open Space series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film on an issue most important to them. [BBC](2927)2's Community Programme Unit kept this aspect of the channel's tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of Video Diaries and later Video Nation. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.
[BBC](2927) Two has also given various programmes from around the world their first UK broadcasts, and have introduced many more to terrestrial audiences. International shows that have been broadcast on [BBC](2927) Two include M*A*S*H, The Simpsons, 24, Family Guy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Malcolm in the Middle, American Dad!, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Moonlighting, The Tracey Ullman Show and Star Trek: Voyager.
In January 2013, [BBC](2927) Two ceased to show children's programmes and replaced the weekday morning schedule with repeats of the previous [BBC](2927) One daytime schedule, children's programmes was returned in 2017 and 2022 in Saturday morning. It also began showing Sign Zone in the early hours; prior to 2013, this had been broadcast by [BBC](2927) One. This was the only channel that broadcast Sign Zone in the early hours until the relaunch of [BBC](2927) Three as a television channel in 2022.
From October 2013, [BBC](2927) Two has shown classic programmes like Bergerac, Cagney and Lacey, The Rockford Files, 'Allo 'Allo!, and Are You Being Served? on weekday afternoons, with the retro logos from 1970s and 1980s, between the current programmes.
In October 2014, Russell Howard's Good News and Backchat moved to [BBC](2927) Two from [BBC](2927) Three.
In 2014, [BBC](2927) Two commissioned Britain's first transgender sitcom, Boy Meets Girl, which follows the developing relationship between Leo, a 26-year-old man, and Judy, a 40-year-old transgender woman.
From 7 April 2015, the morning Sign Zone was shown before Victoria Derbyshire 8:00am-9:00 am including See Hear on Wednesday morning.
[BBC](2927) Two is also known for broadcasting some news and current affairs programmes. It broadcasts [BBC](2927) News updates every morning at 9 am, simulcasting the [BBC](2927) News channel after it stops simulcasting [BBC](2927) Breakfast on [BBC](2927)1. This includes an edition of [BBC](2927) Business Today at 11:30 and Sportsday at 11:45, then fifteen minutes of [BBC](2927) News Now, this had previously been between 2006-2010 an edition of World News Today and 2010-2011  GMT . At 12:15 pm during the Parliament session, political debate programme Politics Live is broadcast on [BBC](2927) Two. On Wednesdays, due to the Prime Minister's Questions, the programme is broadcast at the earlier time of 11:15am. The programme is not broadcast on Fridays or when Parliament is on a holiday break, so the simulcast of [BBC](2927) News Now continues until 1:00pm for the [BBC](2927) News at One on [BBC](2927) One. At 10:30pm, current affairs programme Newsnight provides reports and analysis of the stories behind the day's headlines. [BBC](2927) Two does not broadcast any news and current affairs programming at the weekend.
From 2017 until 2019, it broadcast the UK selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest, Eurovision: You Decide. The channel stopped broadcasting the show after the 2019 edition due to the fact that the [BBC](2927) opted for an internal selection in collaboration with BMG Rights Management.
In 2020, it was reported that the programme Victoria Derbyshire would end, owing to the [BBC](2927)'s £80m cuts. Since the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic, Victoria Derbyshire has been presenting the first hour of [BBC](2927) News, which continues until 13:00.
[BBC](2927) Two is also known for broadcasting some [BBC](2927) One programmes in a change to the schedules when that channel is broadcasting a [BBC](2927) News Special. For example; during the Coronavirus pandemic, [BBC](2927)1 aired press conferences from the UK government about major developments from the pandemic and the scheduled [BBC](2927) One programming during those News Specials was broadcast on [BBC](2927) Two. However, on 9 April 2021 – the day of the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh – [BBC](2927) Two and [BBC](2927) One both simulcast [BBC](2927) News for the whole day. The same would happen on both 8 and 19 September 2022, following the death and state funeral respectively of Elizabeth II.

Ratings and reception
In a 2013 [BBC](2927) Populus poll, [BBC](2927) Two had the third-highest per-country TV channel quality rating among viewers surveyed in 14 countries, behind [BBC](2927) One and Brazil's TV Cultura.

Presentation and former logos
The 1991 idents featured a sans-serif numeral 2 at the centre of an initially art-related scene; however, the idents moved away from this style as the station's style changed. Although highly praised, this expansive set of idents was ended in November 2001. The [BBC](2927) corporate logo was updated within the idents in October 1997, though the idents moved away from the original viridian colour scheme in these latter years. The subsequent presentation style was introduced on 19 November 2001 and kept the same figure 2, but in a yellow background and given a personality. At the time, [BBC](2927) Two became the first [BBC](2927) channel to feature a box logo.
In 2007, [BBC](2927) Two debuted the new theme, a "Window on the World", with the 2 numeral providing that view. Introduced on 18 February 2007, the new look also had the channel adopt a teal-coloured box logo, featuring the [BBC](2927) logo above the word TWO, now in the font Avenir.
In 2014, in honour of the channel's 50th anniversary, some of the 1990s idents were re-introduced and from 2015, [BBC](2927) Two Northern Ireland opted to use nearly forty idents from the 1991–2001 set.
On 27 September 2018, the 1991–2001 idents were retired once again and [BBC](2927) Two introduced a new set of idents, based on scenes incorporating a curve motif resembling the number 2. The new branding is designed to reflect [BBC](2927) Two's "constant evolution, constant eclecticism, and constant sense of quality". The new idents are produced by various artists and studios, including Aardman Animations, The Mill and others. The new identity was developed by [BBC](2927) Creative and Superunion.

Regional variations
[BBC](2927) Two also has regional variations in Wales and Northern Ireland, which occasionally opt out of the national [BBC](2927) Two feed to air programmes of local interest.
In November 2001, [BBC](2927) Wales introduced a special opt-out service  known as [BBC](2927) 2W, which aired weekdays from 8.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the [BBC](2927) Two Wales channel space on digital television, and carried a separate schedule of Welsh-produced programming in comparison to the analogue [BBC](2927) Two Wales. [BBC](2927) 2W was discontinued in 2008 due to the transition to digital terrestrial television, with the main [BBC](2927) Two Wales schedule being carried on Freeview thereafter.
[BBC](2927) Two Scotland operated until February 2019, when it was replaced by the national feed. Concurrently, a bespoke [BBC](2927) Scotland channel was launched, which simulcasts the [BBC](2927) Two schedule with opt-outs for local programming from 7:00 p.m. to midnight nightly, and occasionally during the afternoon for news and sports programmes.

Availability outside the UK
The Northern Irish version of [BBC](2927) Two is widely available in the Republic of Ireland on satellite and cable, as well as being received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales. The national version of [BBC](2927) Two is also available on cable and IPTV in the [Netherlands](2285), Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco and Liechtenstein. 
The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator – ALIA.
On 27 March 2013, it began being carried by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS2 TV channel, which already carried a selection of [BBC](2927) Two programmes. It shares a channel with C[BBC](2927), which broadcasts from early morning until the early evening.
All feeds of [BBC](2927) Two in both SD and HD are broadcast unencrypted on the Astra 2E and 2G satellites, allowing viewing across Belgium, the [Netherlands](2285), the Republic of Ireland and parts of France, Germany and Spain.

Accessibility
The [BBC](2927) announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties. These are available on the [BBC](2927) Red Button, and until 23 October 2012, via the Ceefax teletext service.
The [BBC](2927) also offers audio description on some popular programmes for visually impaired-viewers as well as British sign language interpretation on some of its programmes for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. The percentage of the [BBC](2927)'s total television output with audio description available is 10%, having been increased from 8% in 2008.

[BBC](2927) Two HD
Originally, programmes from [BBC](2927) Two were shown in high definition on the dedicated [BBC](2927) HD channel, alongside programmes from [BBC](2927) Three and [BBC](2927) Four, as well as some select series from C[BBC](2927) and CBeebies. However, in plans outlined by the director general Mark Thompson on 6 October 2011, [BBC](2927) HD would close to be replaced by [BBC](2927) Two HD, a high-definition simulcast of [BBC](2927) Two that would work much the same way as [BBC](2927) One HD. This move allowed the corporation to save £2.1 million, used to count towards its budget deficit following the freezing of the licence fee and the additional financial responsibility of addition services.
On 19 February 2013, it was announced that [BBC](2927) Two HD would replace [BBC](2927) HD from 6.05 a.m. on 26 March 2013. Channel numbers for the [BBC](2927)'s HD channels also changed on Sky, to allow [BBC](2927) One HD and [BBC](2927) Two HD to sit side-by-side on channels 141, and 142 respectively on the EPG.
On 16 July 2013, the [BBC](2927) indicated that it wants to launch Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh variations of [BBC](2927) Two HD; however, this would require the approval of the [BBC](2927) Trust, with a proposal due to be presented within six months.
On 10 December 2013, [BBC](2927) Two HD was swapped with the SD channel in England on Sky's EPG for HD subscribers.
In October 2018, the [BBC](2927) announced that regional variants of [BBC](2927) Two HD in Wales and Northern Ireland would launch at the end of November that year on terrestrial, satellite (Wales only) and iPlayer. [BBC](2927) Two HD in these regions were swapped with the SD channel on Sky's EPG for HD subscribers. A Scotland variant was not launched, as [BBC](2927) Two Scotland was discontinued in February 2019 in favour of the new [BBC](2927) Scotland channel. [BBC](2927) Two Northern Ireland HD later eventually launched on Sky and Freesat on 5 January 2023, with the SD version shutting down on Sky and Freesat on 24 January 2023.
