Abraham in Islam
[Abraham](1735) (Arabic: ابراهيم, romanized: Ibrāhīm) was a prophet and messenger of God according to [Islam](5101), and an ancestor to the Ishmaelite [Arabs](4634) and Israelites. [Abraham](1735) plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and [Islam](5101). According to the [Islam](5101)ic perspective, [Abraham](1735) fulfilled all the commandments and trials wherein God nurtured him throughout his lifetime. As a result of his unwavering faith in God, [Abraham](1735) was promised by God to be a leader to all the nations of the world. The Qur'an extols [Abraham](1735) as a model and exemplar: obedient and not an idolater. In this sense, [Abraham](1735) has been described as representing "primordial man in universal surrender to the Divine Reality before its fragmentation into religions separated from each other by differences in form".: 18  Muslims believe that the Ka'aba in Mecca was built by [Abraham](1735) and his son Isma'il (Arabic: إسماعيل or إسمٰعيل, romanized: ʼIsmāʻīl, lit. 'Ishmael') as the first house of worship on Earth. The [Islam](5101)ic holy day, Eid al-Adha, is celebrated partly in commemoration of [Abraham](1735)'s willingness to sacrifice his son on God's command.
Muslims believe that [Abraham](1735) became the leader of the righteous in his time and that it was through him that Adnanite-[Arabs](4634) and Israelites came. [Abraham](1735), in the belief of [Islam](5101), was instrumental in cleansing the world of idolatry at his time. Paganism was cleared out by [Abraham](1735) in both the [Arabian Peninsula](5186) and Canaan. He spiritually purified both places as well as physically sanctifying the houses of worship. [Abraham](1735) and Isma'il (Ishmael) further established the rites of pilgrimage, or Ḥajj ('Pilgrimage'), which are still followed by Muslims today. Muslims maintain that [Abraham](1735) further asked God to bless both the lines of his progeny, of Isma'il and Isḥaq (Isaac), and to keep all of his descendants in the protection of God.

Quranic account and [Islam](5101)ic tradition
Family
Muslims maintain that [Abraham](1735)'s father was not Azar, (Arabic: آزَر, romanized: Āzar), which could be derived from Eusebius' reference to his father Athar in Koine Greek, but Tarakh who is known in the Hebrew Bible as Terah. [Abraham](1735) had two children, Ishmael and Isaac, who both later became prophets. [Abraham](1735)'s nephew is said to have been the messenger Lut (Lot), who was one of the other people who migrated with [Abraham](1735) out of their community. [Abraham](1735) himself is said to have been a descendant of Nuh through his son Shem.

Personality and wisdom
[Abraham](1735)'s personality and character are one of the most in-depth in the whole Qur'an, and [Abraham](1735) is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man. [Abraham](1735)'s father is understood by Muslims to have been a wicked, ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between [Abraham](1735) and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to [Abraham](1735)'s story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of [Abraham](1735)'s personality. The Qur'an mentions that [Abraham](1735)'s father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease preaching to the people. Despite this, the Qur'an states that [Abraham](1735) in his later years prayed to God to forgive the sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited [Abraham](1735)'s character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, especially one's own parents. A similar example of [Abraham](1735)'s compassionate nature is demonstrated when [Abraham](1735) began to pray for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told [Abraham](1735) that God's plan was the final word, and therefore [Abraham](1735)'s prayers would be of no effect, the Qur'an nonetheless reinforces [Abraham](1735)'s kind nature through this particular event.

Youth
Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized [Ancient Mesopotamian religion](4869). His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors' rituals and mocking their idols.
Despite his opposition to idolatry, his father Azar would still send Ibrahim to sell his idols in the marketplace. Once there, Ibrahim would call out to passersby, "Who will buy my idols? They will not help you and they cannot hurt you! Who will buy my idols?" Then Ibrahim would mock the idols. He would take them to the river, push their faces into the water and command them, "Drink! Drink!" Once again, Ibrahim asked his father, "How can you worship what does not see or hear or do you any good?" Azar replied, "Dare you deny the gods of our people? Get out of my sight!" Ibrahim replied, "May God forgive you. No more will I live with you and your idols." After this, Ibrahim left his father's home for good. During one of the many festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols. Ur's most prominent temple is the Great Ziggurat, which can be seen today. Ibrahim would ask them, "What are you worshipping? Do these idols hear when you call them? Can they help you or hurt you?" The people would reply, "It is the way of our forefathers." Ibrahim declared "I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy." After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.

Searching for the truth
One night, [Abraham](1735) went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, "Could this be my Lord?" But when it set he said: "I don't like those that set." The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, "Could this be my Lord?" but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" But when the sun also set he said, "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with God! I have turned my face towards God who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with God. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." After this declaration, [Abraham](1735) then heard God calling him, "O [Abraham](1735)" [Abraham](1735) trembled and said, "Here I am O my Lord!" God replied, "Submit to Me!" [Abraham](1735) fell to the ground, crying. He said: "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [Abraham](1735) kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that God has guided him to the truth.

The great fire
The decision to have [Abraham](1735) burned at the stake was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread throughout the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire that people had ever witnessed since was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. [Abraham](1735)'s hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. During this time, Angel Gabriel came to him and said: "O [Abraham](1735)! Is there anything you wish for?" [Abraham](1735) could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, "God is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. God then gave an order to the fire, "O fire! Be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." A miracle occurred; the fire obeyed and did not harm [Abraham](1735), burning only his chains. [Abraham](1735) came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated, and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: "Amazing! [Abraham](1735)'s God has saved him from the fire!"

Confrontation with Nimrod
The Qur'an discusses a very short conversation between an unrighteous ruler and [Abraham](1735). Although the king in the Qur'an is unnamed, and this fact has been recognized as being least important in the narrative, outside of the Qur'an, namely in some of the tafasir, this king has been suggested to be Nimrod. The Tafsir by Ibn Kathir, a 14th-century scholar, has many embellishments in the narrative, including Nimrod claiming divinity for himself. The Tafsir describes Nimrod's quarrel with Ibrahim, how he (Nimrod) became extremely angry and, in his 'utter disbelief and arrant rebellion,' became a tyrant.
According to Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Nimrod was a man who set his will against that of God. Nimrod proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects. Nimrod's consort Semiramis was also worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also Ninus.) Before [Abraham](1735) was born, a portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of [Abraham](1735), who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, [Abraham](1735)'s mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. Flavius Josephus mentions that [Abraham](1735) confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. Nimrod has his subjects gather enough wood so as to burn [Abraham](1735) in the biggest fire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit and [Abraham](1735) is thrown into it, [Abraham](1735) walks out unscathed. In [Islam](5101), it is debated whether the decision to have Ibrahim burned at the stake came from Nimrod and the temple priests or whether the people themselves became vigilantes and hatched the plan to have him burned at the stake. According to Muslim commentators, after [Abraham](1735) survived the great fire, his fame in society grew. Nimrod, who was the King of Babylon felt that his throne was in danger, and that he was losing power because, upon witnessing Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in God and [Abraham](1735) being a prophet of God. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a god. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, "What can your God do that I cannot?" Ibrahim replied, "My Lord is He who gives life and death." Nimrod then shouted, "I give life and death! I can bring a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life." [Abraham](1735) replied, "Well, my lord God makes the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West?" Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. [Abraham](1735) left him there speechless and went back to his mission of calling people to worship God.
This event has been noted as particularly important because, in the Muslim perspective, it almost foreshadowed the prophetic careers of future prophets, most significantly the career of Moses. [Abraham](1735)'s quarrel with the king has been interpreted by some to be a precursor to Moses's preaching to Pharaoh. Just as the ruler who argued against [Abraham](1735) claimed divinity for himself, so did the Pharaoh of the Exodus, who refused to hear the call of Moses and perished in the Red Sea. In this particular incident, scholars have further commented on [Abraham](1735)'s wisdom in employing "rational, wise and target-oriented" speech, as opposed to pointless arguments.
[Abraham](1735), in the eyes of many Muslims, also symbolized the highest moral values essential to any person. The Qur'an details the account of the angels coming to [Abraham](1735) to tell him of the birth of Ismael. It says that, as soon as [Abraham](1735) saw the messengers, he "hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf." This action has been interpreted by all the scholars as exemplary; many scholars have commentated upon this one action, saying that it symbolizes [Abraham](1735)'s exceedingly high moral level and thus is a model for how men should act in a similar situation. This incident has only further heightened the "compassionate" character of [Abraham](1735) in Muslim theology.

Sacrifice
Ibrahim’s dream of sacrificing his son was a command by God. The Qur'anic verses which describe this dream are in Surah As-Saffat, 37:100–107: "100. My Lord, grant me a child from among the righteous." 101. So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. 102. And when he reached with him the age of exertion, he said, "O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice you, so see what you think." He said, "O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if [Allah](5160) wills, of the steadfast." 103. And when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead, 104. We called to him, "O [Abraham](1735), 105. You have fulfilled the vision." Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. 106. Indeed, this was the clear trial. 107. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice, (Zibhin azeem)".
This great sacrifice denotes the importance of the ram that replaced Ibraheem's son. Tafsir ibn Kathir records Ibn Abbas' explanation of the verse, according to Muhammad's teachings. The explanation is as follows:

"And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice" (37:107). It was reported that Ibn `Abbas (may God be pleased with him) said, "A ram which had grazed in Paradise for forty years."
The Tafsir further goes on to say that the ram's horns were preserved until the time of Muhammad:

 Imam Ahmad recorded that Safiyyah bint Shaybah said, "A woman from Bani Sulaym, who was the midwife of most of the people in our household, told me that the Messenger of God sent for `Uthman bin Talhah, may God be pleased with him.'' On one occasion she said, "I asked `Uthman, `Why did the Prophet call you' He said, `The Messenger of God said to me, I saw the horns of the ram when I entered the House (i.e., the Ka`bah), and I forgot to tell you to cover them up; cover them up, for there should not be anything in the House which could distract the worshipper.)''' Sufyan said, "The horns of the ram remained hanging in the House until it was burned, and they were burned too.'' The Quraysh had inherited the horns of the ram that [Abraham](1735) sacrificed, and they had been passed down from generation to generation, until the Messenger of God was sent. And God knows best.
From that day onwards, every Eid al-Adha once a year Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate [Abraham](1735)'s sacrifice and to remind themselves of self-abnegation in the way of God, and they would share the meat among friends, family, the poor and the needy. This is called Qurbani ("sacrifice").

Tabari's account
The classical Quranic exegete and historian Tabari offered two versions, whom [Abraham](1735) was ordered to sacrifice. According to the first strand, [Abraham](1735) wished for a righteous son, whereupon an angel appeared to him informing him, that he will get a righteous son, but when he was born and reached puberty, he must be sacrificed for God. Later, the angel appeared to Hagar to inform her about the upcoming child. When Ishmael was grown, someone appeared to [Abraham](1735), invites him to keep his vow.

 When Ishmael was grown, someone appeared to [Abraham](1735) in a dream and said to him: "Keep your vow which you made! God bestowed upon you a boy by Hagar so that you may sacrifice him" So he said to Ishmael: "Let us go offer a sacrifice to God!" So he took a knife and some rope and went with him until they reached a place in the mountains. The boy said to him: "Oh father! Where is your sacrifice?" He replied: "Oh my son, I saw in a dream, that I will slaughter you. So pay attention to what you see". He said, "Oh my father, do what you have been commanded; you will find me, Insha-[Allah](5160) (if God wills), one of the patient". Ishmael then said to him: "Make tight my bonds, so that I will not struggle to pull back your clothes so that none of my blood will be shed on them for Hagar will see it and be grieved. Hurry! Pass the knife over my throat so that death will be easy for me. When you come to Hagar, greet her'. [Abraham](1735) began to approach him and, while crying, tied him up. Ishmael too was crying such that the tears gathered by the cheek of Ishmael. He then drew the knife along his throat but the knife did not cut, for God had placed a sheet of copper on the throat of Ishmael. When he saw that, he turned him on his forehead and nicked him on the back of the head just as God has said in Quran 37:103: When they had both submitted and he flung on his forehead, that is they had submitted the affair to God. A voice called out: '[Abraham](1735), you have fulfilled the vision!" He turned around and behold, there was a ram. He took it and released his son and he bent over his son saying: "Oh my son, today you have been given to me". That comes in God's saying in Quran 37:107: We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.
The second strand, provided by Tabari, states that [Abraham](1735) was about to sacrifice his son Ishmael, and Iblis appeared in form of a man to prevent the sacrifice.

 Iblis (Satan), who had taken on the form of a man, said: "Where are you going, O Shaikh?" He replied: " I am going to these mountains because I must do something there'. Iblis said: "By God, I have seen that Shaytan has come to you in a dream and ordered you to slaughter this little son of yours. And you intend to do that slaughtering!" Thereupon [Abraham](1735) recognized him and said: "Get away from me, enemy of God! By God, I will most certainly continue to do what my Lord has commanded". Iblis, the enemy of God, gave up on [Abraham](1735) but then he encountered Ishmael, who was behind [Abraham](1735) carrying the wood and the large knife. He said to him: "O young man, do you realize where your father is taking you?" He said: "To gather wood for our family from the mountains". He replied: "By God, his actual intention is to sacrifice you!" He said: "Why?!" Iblis replied: "He claims that his Lord has ordered him to do so!" Ishmael replied: "He must do what his Lord commands, absolutely!" When the young man had rebuffed him, Iblis went to Hagar, the mother of Ishmael who was still at home. Iblis said to her: "Oh mother of Ishmael! Do you realize where [Abraham](1735) is going with Ishmael?" She replied: "They have gone to gather wood for us in the mountains". He said: "He has actually gone in order to sacrifice him!" She replied: "It cannot be! He is too kind and too loving towards him to do that!" Iblis said: "He claims that God has ordered him to do that!" Hagar said: "If his Lord has ordered him to do that then he must submit to the command of God!" So the enemy of God returned exasperated at not being able to influence the family of [Abraham](1735) as he wished.

Miracles
[Abraham](1735) encountered several miracles of God during his lifetime. The Quran records a few main miracles, although different interpretations have been attributed to the passages. Some of the miracles recorded in the Quran are:

[Abraham](1735) was shown the kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth.
[Abraham](1735) and the miracle of the birds.
[Abraham](1735) was thrown into a fire, which became "cool" and "peaceful" for him.
The first passage has been interpreted both literally, allegorically, and otherwise. Although some commentators feel that this passage referred to a physical miracle, where [Abraham](1735) was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven (Jannah), others have felt that it refers to the spiritual understanding of [Abraham](1735); these latter scholars maintain that the Chaldeans were skilled in the observance of the stars, but [Abraham](1735), who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the Quranic commentators, that [Abraham](1735) took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called out to them, each piece joined and four birds flew back to [Abraham](1735). This miracle, as told by the Quranic passage, was a demonstration by God to show [Abraham](1735) how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show [Abraham](1735) the power God has to raise the dead to life. The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the 'fire' refers to the main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which [Abraham](1735) was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the 'fire of persecution', from which [Abraham](1735) was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.

Title
[Abraham](1735) is given the title Khalilullah (Arabic: خَلِیْل‌ ٱلله, romanized: Ḫalīl Allāḥ, lit. 'Friend of God') in [Islam](5101). The Quran says:

And who is better in faith than those who ˹fully˺ submit themselves to [Allah](5160), do good, and follow the Way of [Abraham](1735), the upright? [Allah](5160) chose [Abraham](1735) as a close friend.
This particular title of [Abraham](1735) is so famous in Muslim culture and tradition that, in the areas in and around Mecca, [Abraham](1735) is often referred to solely as Al-Khalil (Arabic: ألخَلِیْل‌, romanized: Al-Ḫalīl, lit. 'The Friend'). The title Friend of God is not exclusive to [Islam](5101)ic theology. Although the other religious traditions do not stress upon it, [Abraham](1735) is called a Friend of God in the second Book of Chronicles and the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as well as in the New Testament.

Relationship with [Islam](5101)ic shrines
One of [Abraham](1735)'s most important features in [Islam](5101)ic theology is his role as the constructor of the Ka'aba. Although tradition recounts that [Adam](110) constructed the original Kaaba, which was demolished by the Great Flood at the time of Noah, [Abraham](1735)—alongside his son, Ismael—is believed to have rebuilt it in its original form. The Quran, in the Muslim perspective, merely confirms or reinforces the laws of pilgrimage. The rites were instituted by [Abraham](1735) and for all Muslims, as they perform the pilgrimage, the event is a way to return to the perfection of [Abraham](1735)'s faith. Just as Medina is referred to as the "City of the Prophet Muhammad" or simply the "City of Muhammad", Mecca is frequently cited as the "City of [Abraham](1735)", because [Abraham](1735)'s reformation of the monotheistic faith is believed to have taken place in Mecca. Likewise, [Islam](5101)ic belief links the original sanctuary of [Al-Aqsa](5135) in the Old City of Jerusalem to [Abraham](1735).

Suhuf Ibrahim
The Quran refers to certain Scrolls of [Abraham](1735). All Muslim scholars have generally agreed that no scrolls of [Abraham](1735) survive, and therefore this is a reference to a lost body of scripture. The Scrolls of [Abraham](1735) are understood by Muslims to refer to certain revelations [Abraham](1735) received, which he would have then transmitted to writing. The exact contents of the revelation are not described in the Qur'an.
The 87th chapter of the Qur'an, Surah al-A'la, concludes by saying the subject matter of the sura has been in the earlier scriptures of [Abraham](1735) and Moses. It is slightly indicative of what were in the previous scriptures, according to [Islam](5101):

Chapter 53 of the Qur'an, Surah an-Najm, also describes the earlier scriptures of [Abraham](1735) and Musa (Moses):

Yet some scholars suggested it to be a reference to the Sefer Yetzirah, as Jewish tradition generally ascribed its authorship to [Abraham](1735). Other scholars, however, wrote of a certain Testament of [Abraham](1735), which they explained was available at the time of Muhammad.
The Quran contains numerous references to [Abraham](1735), his life, prayers, and traditions and has a dedicated chapter named Ibrahim. On a relevant note, Surah al-Kahf was revealed as an answer from God to the Jews who inquired of Muhammad about past events. Here God directly instructed Muhammad in surah Al-Kahf, not to consult the Jews for verifying the three stories about which they inquired.

Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge,1 nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them.
The reason being God declaring He Himself is relating what needs to be verified in another verse of al-Kahf:

We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
Regarding consultation with the People of the Book, it is also narrated by Abu Hurairah in a hadith:

Narrated Abu Huraira: The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that God's Apostle said, "Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say: 'We believe in God and what is revealed to us.'"
Therefore, relating to any ascription of the Scrolls of [Abraham](1735) by the people of the book is not required.

Significance as a patriarch
[Abraham](1735) is also extremely important as a leader of [Islam](5101) and as a patriarch of the [Islam](5101)ic faith. Muslims recognize [Abraham](1735) as the ancestor through whom many other prophets and saints (Wali) came, including Moses, Jesus ('Isa) and Muhammad. The Qur'an lists, in its sixth chapter, Al-An'am, some of the greatest figures to have existed through [Abraham](1735)'s progeny:

This was the argument We gave [Abraham](1735) against his people. We elevate in rank whoever We please. Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We previously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. This is how We reward the good-doers.Likewise, ˹We guided˺ Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of the righteous. ˹We also guided˺ Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, favouring each over other people ˹of their time˺.And ˹We favoured˺ some of their forefathers, their descendants, and their brothers. We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path.
[Abraham](1735)'s narrative in the Qur'an indirectly refers to his role as one of the great patriarchs. The Qur'an states that God made [Abraham](1735) "an Imam to the Nations" and father to Muslims, and his narrative records him praying for his offspring. The Qur'an further notes that [Abraham](1735)'s descendants were given "the Book and Wisdom", and this fact is reinforced in another verse which states that [Abraham](1735)'s family was one of those in which the gift of prophecy was established as a generic trait. The Qur'an emphasizes upon [Abraham](1735)'s significance as it states that [Abraham](1735)'s family, Noah, [Adam](110) and the family of Amram were the four selected by God above all the worlds. As a result of his significance as a patriarch, [Abraham](1735) is sometimes given the title Father of the Prophets. Of [Abraham](1735)'s immediate sons, the Quran repeatedly establishes the gifts God bestowed upon them. Ishmael, along with Elisha and Dhul-Kifl (possibly Ezekiel), is regarded as being "of the Company of the Good." and one of the men who was given "favour above the nations." In addition, Ishmael is described as being "true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet." Likewise, the Qur'an says of Isaac that he was "of the company of the Elect and the Good" and was "a prophet—one of the Righteous," further describing him as "of Power and Vision."

Burial place
Muslims believe that [Abraham](1735) was buried, along with his wife Sarah, at the Cave of the Patriarchs in the Old City of Hebron, the West Bank. Known to Muslims as the Sanctuary of [Abraham](1735) it is also thought to be the burial site of his son Isaac, his wife Rebecca, their son Jacob, and his wife Leah.

Narrative in the Quran
References
There are numerous references to [Abraham](1735) in the Quran, including, twice, to the Scrolls of [Abraham](1735); in the latter passage, it is mentioned that [Abraham](1735) "fulfilled his engagements?-", a reference to all the trials that [Abraham](1735) had succeeded in. In a whole series of chapters, the Qur'an relates how [Abraham](1735) preached to his community as a youth and how he specifically told his father, named Azar, to leave idol-worship and come to the worship of God. Some passages of the Quran, meanwhile, deal with the story of how God sent angels to [Abraham](1735) with the announcement of the punishment to be imposed upon Lot's people in Sodom and Gomorrah. Other verses mention the near-sacrifice of [Abraham](1735)'s son, whose name is not given but is presumed to be Ishmael as the following verses mention the birth of Isaac. The Quran also repeatedly establishes [Abraham](1735)'s role as patriarch and mentions numerous important descendants who came through his lineage, including Isaac, Jacob and Ishmael. In the later chapters of the Quran, [Abraham](1735)'s role becomes yet more prominent. The Quran mentions that [Abraham](1735) and Ishmael were the reformers who set up the Ka‘bah in Mecca as a center of pilgrimage for monotheism The Quran consistently refers to [Islam](5101) as "the Religion of [Abraham](1735)" (millat Ibrahim) and [Abraham](1735) is given a title as Hanif (The Pure, "true in Faith" or "upright man"). The Quran also mentions [Abraham](1735) as one whom God took as a friend (Khalil), hence [Abraham](1735)'s title in [Islam](5101), Khalil-[Allah](5160) (Friend of God). The term is considered by some to be a derivation of the patriarch's title, Qal El (Hebrew: קל-אל, "Voice of God"). Other instances in the Quran which are described in a concise manner are the rescue of [Abraham](1735) from the fire into which he was thrown by his people'; his pleading for his father; his quarrel with an unrighteous and powerful king and the miracle of the dead birds.
All these events and more have been discussed with more details in Muslim tradition, and especially in the Stories of the Prophets and works of universal [Islam](5101)ic theology. Certain episodes from the life of [Abraham](1735) have been more heavily detailed in [Islam](5101)ic text, such as the arguments between [Abraham](1735) and the evil king, Nimrod, the near-sacrifice of his son, and the story of Hagar and Ishmael, which Muslims commemorate when performing pilgrimage in Mecca. An important [Islam](5101)ic religious holiday, Eid al-Adha, commemorates [Abraham](1735)'s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God, before God intervened to provide him with a sheep to sacrifice instead. In some cases, some believe these legends in [Islam](5101)ic text may have influenced later Jewish tradition.
