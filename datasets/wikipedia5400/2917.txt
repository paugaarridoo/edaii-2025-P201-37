Antonius Musa
Antonius Musa (Ancient Greek: Ἀντώνιος Μούσας, Antṓnios Moúsas) was a Greek botanist and the Roman Emperor [Augustus](2924)'s physician; Antonius was a freedman who received freeborn status along with other honours. In the year 23 BC, when [Augustus](2924) was seriously ill, Musa cured the illness with cold compresses and became immediately famous.
Musa, the plant group which includes the banana, the plantain and numerous other species, was apparently named after him.  However, Musa may be a Latinization of the Arabic name for the fruit, mauz (موز). Mauz meaning Musa is discussed in the 11th century Arabic encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine, which was translated to Latin in medieval times and well known in Europe.
Musa's brother was Euphorbus, physician to king Juba II of Numidia, after whom the plant Euphorbia, which has given its name to a scientific genus, was originally named.
A short medical treatise called De Herba Vettonica describing the properties of betony has been transmitted under his name, but is thought instead to have been written in the 4th  century. It seems to have been a source for the Roman medical writer Theodorus Priscianus.
According to Francis Atterbury, the character Iapis in Virgil's Aeneid represents Musa while Aeneas represents [Augustus](2924).
