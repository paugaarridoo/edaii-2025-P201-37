4671
Cambodia
[Cambodia](4671), officially the Kingdom of [Cambodia](4671), is a country in Southeast [Asia](1914) on the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the north, Vietnam to the east, and has a coastline along the Gulf of Thailand in the southwest. It spans an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles), and has a population of about 17 million. Its capital and most populous city is Phnom Penh, followed by Siem Reap and Battambang.
In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring Khmer princes of Chenla under the name "Kambuja". This marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire. The [India](2798)nised kingdom facilitated the spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to Southeast [Asia](1914) and undertook religious infrastructural projects throughout the region. In the 15th century, it began a decline in power (the Post-Angkor Period) until, in 1863, it became the French Protectorate of [Cambodia](4671).
After the Japanese occupation of [Cambodia](4671) during the Second World War, it gained independence in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 via the Ho Chi Minh and Sihanouk trails. A 1970 coup installed the US-aligned Khmer Republic, which was overthrown by the Khmer Rouge in 1975. The Khmer Rouge ruled the country and carried out the [Cambodia](4671)n genocide from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted in the [Cambodia](4671)n–Vietnamese War. The Vietnamese-occupied People's Republic of Kampuchea became the de facto government.
Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords which formally ended the war with Vietnam, [Cambodia](4671) was governed by a United Nations mission (1992–93). The UN withdrew after the 1993 [Cambodia](4671)n general election, decided by around 90% of registered voters. The 1997 coup d'état consolidated power under Prime Minister Hun Sen and the [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party (CPP). While constitutionally a multi-party state, the CPP dominates the political system and dissolved its main opposition party in 2017, making it a de facto one-party state. The UN currently designates it a least developed country.
[Cambodia](4671) is a member of the United Nations, [ASEAN](1264), the RCEP, the East [Asia](1914) Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La Francophonie, and a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Agriculture remains the dominant economic sector, with growth in textiles, construction, garments, and tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international trade. It is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change.

Etymology
The Kingdom of [Cambodia](4671) is the official English name of the country. The English [Cambodia](4671) is an anglicisation of the French Cambodge, which in turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer កម្ពុជា (Kâmpŭchéa, pronounced kampuciə). Kâmpŭchéa is the shortened alternative to the country's official name in Khmer ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា (Preăh Réachéanachâkr Kâmpŭchéa, pronounced preah riəciənaːcak kampuciə. The Khmer endonym កម្ពុជា Kâmpŭchéa derives from the Sanskrit name कम्बोजदेश Kambojadeśa, composed of देश Deśa ("land of" or "country of") and कम्बोज (Kamboja), referring to the descendants of Kambu (a legendary [India](2798)n sage from the ancient [India](2798)n kingdom of Kamboja). The term [Cambodia](4671) was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since [Antonio Pigafetta](2916) cites it in his work Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524–1525) as Camogia.
Scholar George Coedes refers to a 10th-century inscription of a [Cambodia](4671)n dynastic legend in which the hermit Kambu Swayambhuva and the celestial nymph Mera unite and establish the [Cambodia](4671)n Solar royal dynasty (Kambu-Mera), that begins with the Chenla ruler Srutavarman and his son Sreshthavarman. Coedes suggests that the Kambu Swayambhuva legend has its origins in southern [India](2798), as a version of the Kanchi Pallava dynasty creation myth.
Colloquially, [Cambodia](4671)ns refer to their country as either Srok Khmer (ស្រុកខ្មែរ Srŏk Khmêr, pronounced srok kʰmae; meaning "Land of the Khmers"), or the slightly more formal ប្រទេសកម្ពុជា (Prâtés Kâmpŭchéa, pronounced prɑteh kampuciə; "Country of Kampuchea"). The name [Cambodia](4671) is used most often in the Western world while Kampuchea is more widely used in the Eastern world.

History
Prehistory
There exists evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of what later is [Cambodia](4671), which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Kratié provinces, and in Kampot Province. Some archaeological evidence shows communities of hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during the Holocene: the most ancient archaeological discovery site in [Cambodia](4671) is considered to be the cave of Laang Spean, which belongs to the Hoabinhian period. Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 BC. Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in [Cambodia](4671).
Archaeological records for the period between the Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited. An event in prehistory was the penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the third millennium BC. Prehistoric evidence are the "circular earthworks" discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated, and some of them possibly date from the second millennium BC. Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first investigations began in 1875, and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay Meanchey.
Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the Khorat Plateau, in what later is Thailand. In [Cambodia](4671), some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were discovered at the site of Lovea kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials testify to improvement of food availability and trade, and the existence of a social structure and labour organization. Kinds of glass beads recovered from sites, such as the Phum Snay site in the northwest and the Prohear site in the southeast, suggest that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about the 2nd–4th century AD, probably due to changes in socio-political powers.

Pre-Angkorian, Angkorian, and Post-Angkor
During the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the [India](2798)nised states of Funan and its successor, Chenla, coalesced in what later is [Cambodia](4671) and southwestern Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become [Cambodia](4671) absorbed influences from [India](2798), passing them on to other Southeast [Asia](1914)n civilisations that later became Thailand and Laos.
The Khmer Empire grew out of the remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c. 790 – c. 835) declared independence from Java and proclaimed themselves a Devaraja. They and their followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area from the 9th to the 15th centuries. During the rule of Jayavarman VIII the Angkor empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan; the king was able to buy peace. Around the 13th century, Theravada missionaries from Sri Lanka reintroduced Theravada Buddhism to Southeast [Asia](1914), having sent missionaries previously in the 1190s. The religion spread and eventually displaced Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular religion of Angkor; it was not the official state religion until 1295 when Indravarman III took power.
The Khmer Empire was Southeast [Asia](1914)'s largest empire during the 12th century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square kilometres (1,151 square miles). The city could have supported a population of up to 1 million people.
After a series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown.

 
The hill tribe people were "hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the [Cambodia](4671)ns".
Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the Mekong Delta had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698, with King Chey Chettha II granting the Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before.

French colonisation
In 1863, King Norodom signed a treaty of protection with France. The protectorate of France period lasted until 1953, with a brief interruption during while the kingdom was occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945 and simultaneously existing as the puppet state of Kingdom of Kampuchea in 1945. Between 1874 and 1962, the total population increased from about 946,000 to 5.7 million. After King Norodom's death in 1904, France manipulated the choice of king and Sisowath, Norodom's brother, was placed on the throne. The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France passed over Monivong's son, Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath was enthroned. The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control. Under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, [Cambodia](4671) gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.

Kingdom (1953–1970)
In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the [Cold War](2999). Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use [Cambodia](4671) as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object unless [Cambodia](4671)ns were killed.
The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968. In public Sihanouk refuted the right of the U.S. to use air strikes in [Cambodia](4671), and on 26 March he said "these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop". On 28 March a press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international media: "I appeal to you to publicise abroad this very clear stand of [Cambodia](4671)—that is, I will, in any case, oppose all bombings on [Cambodia](4671)n territory under whatever pretext." Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued.

Khmer Republic (1970–1975)
While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. Once the coup was completed, the new regime, which demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave [Cambodia](4671), gained the political support of the [United States](1100). The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war.

Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. From 1970 until 1972, the [Cambodia](4671)n conflict was largely between the government and army of [Cambodia](4671), and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of [Cambodia](4671)n territory, the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the [Cambodia](4671)n communists now referred to as the Khmer Rouge.
Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun [Cambodia](4671) in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea. NVA units overran [Cambodia](4671)n army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered [Cambodia](4671) in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in [Cambodia](4671) (see [Cambodia](4671)n Incursion).
On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days, led to the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for [Cambodia](4671). The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, 5 days after the US mission evacuated [Cambodia](4671).

Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1978)
Estimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime range from approximately 1 to 3 million; a cited figure is 2 million (about a quarter of the population). This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol Sleng became known for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham Muslims underwent purges with as much as half of their population exterminated. Pol Pot was determined to keep his power and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people.
Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in [Cambodia](4671) from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984. Most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, were targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, "eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star" as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism.
Religious institutions were targeted by the Khmer Rouge. The majority of Khmer architecture, 95% of [Cambodia](4671)'s Buddhist temples, were destroyed.

Vietnamese occupation and transition (1978–1992)
In November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded [Cambodia](4671) in response to border raids by the Khmer Rouge and conquered it. The People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established as a pro-Soviet state led by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a party created by the Vietnamese in 1951, and led by a group of Khmer Rouge who had fled [Cambodia](4671) to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok. It was fully beholden to the occupying Vietnamese army and under the direction of the Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh. Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) was formed in 1981 from 3 factions. This consisted of the Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge representative to UN, Thiounn Prasith, was retained, and he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist [Cambodia](4671)n parties. The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw from [Cambodia](4671) led to economic sanctions.
Peace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of [Cambodia](4671), culminating 2 years later in October 1991 in a Paris Comprehensive Peace Settlement. The UN was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in [Cambodia](4671) (UNTAC).

Kingdom (1993–)
In 1993, the monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk reinstated as King, and the first post-war election was coordinated by UNTAC. The election was won by FUNCINPEC led by Sihanouk's son Ranariddh in a hung parliament. A power-sharing agreement was agreed with Ranariddh and Hun Sen of the [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party both simultaneously being co-Prime Ministers after the CPP threatened to secede part of the country if power was fully transferred to FUNCINPEC. The stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d'état led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ousted Ranariddh and other parties represented in the government and consolidated power for CPP. After its government was able to stabilize under Sen, [Cambodia](4671) was accepted into the Association of Southeast [Asia](1914)n Nations ([ASEAN](1264)) on 30 April 1999. Norodom Sihamoni was crowned [Cambodia](4671)'s king in 2004 after his father Sihanouk's abdication.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, reconstruction efforts progressed which led to some political stability through a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy although Sen's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and corruption. [Cambodia](4671)'s economy grew rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s, and it received considerable investment and infrastructure development support from [China](2217) as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.A UN-backed war crimes tribunal, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal sought out to investigate crimes committed during the Democratic Kampuchea period and prosecute its leaders. Hun Sen has opposed extensive trials or investigations of former Khmer Rouge officials. In July 2010, Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the S21 extermination camp and he was sentenced to life in prison. In August 2014, the tribunal sentenced Khieu Samphan, the regime's 83-year-old former head of state, and Nuon Chea, its 88-year-old chief ideologue, to life in prison on war crimes charges for their role in the country's terror period in the 1970s.
After the 2013 [Cambodia](4671)n general election, allegations of voter fraud from opposition party [Cambodia](4671) National Rescue Party led to widespread anti-government protests that continued into the following year. The protests ended after a crackdown by government forces. The [Cambodia](4671) National Rescue Party was dissolved ahead of the 2018 [Cambodia](4671)n general election and the ruling [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party also enacted tighter curbs on mass media. The CPP won every seat in the National Assembly without major opposition, effectively solidifying de facto one-party rule in the country.
The global COVID-19 pandemic spread to [Cambodia](4671) in early 2020. Despite minimising the disease's spread for much of 2020 the country's health system was put under strain by a major outbreak in early 2021, which prompted several lockdowns. It also had a severe economic impact, with the tourism industry particularly affected due to international travel restrictions.
Prime Minister Hun Sen assumed office 39 years ago and is one of the world's longest-serving leaders. He has been accused of crackdowns on opponents and critics. In December 2021, Hun Sen announced his support for his son Hun Manet to succeed him after the next general election in 2023. In October 2022, Hun Sen warned CPP members that the country's newest and largest opposition party, the Candlelight Party, may be dissolved before the 2023 general election. The warning comes after a June 2022 lawsuit filed by the National Election Committee against the party's deputy president, Son Chhay, accusing him of defamation by speaking out against electoral fraud by the CPP.
A July 2023 Human Rights Watch report showed numerous and significant election fraud and vote tampering in the June 2022 commune elections.
In the July 2023 election, the ruling [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party (CPP) easily won by a landslide in a flawed election, after the disqualification of [Cambodia](4671)'s most important opposition, Candlelight Party. On 22 August 2023, Hun Manet was sworn in as the new [Cambodia](4671)n prime minister.

Geography
[Cambodia](4671) has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10° and 15°N, and longitudes 102° and 108°E. It borders Thailand to the north and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf of Thailand.
[Cambodia](4671)'s landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta. Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200 metres) above sea level. In [Cambodia](4671) forest cover is around 46% of the total land area, equivalent to 8,068,370 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 11,004,790 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 7,464,400 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 603,970 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 4% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity). For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.
To the north the [Cambodia](4671)n plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180–550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the Dângrêk Mountains.
Flowing south through [Cambodia](4671)'s eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern [Cambodia](4671) two distinct upland blocks, the Krâvanh Mountains and the Dâmrei Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.
In this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, [Cambodia](4671)'s highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres). The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands.
The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of [Cambodia](4671). Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.

Climate
[Cambodia](4671)'s climate, like that of the most of Mainland Southeast [Asia](1914), is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences.
[Cambodia](4671) has a temperature range from 21 to 35 °C (70 to 95 °F) and experiences tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and [India](2798)n Ocean from May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which lasts from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February.
According to the International Development Research Center and The United Nations, [Cambodia](4671) is considered Southeast [Asia](1914)'s most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change, alongside the Philippines. Nearly all provinces in [Cambodia](4671) are affected by climate change. Rural coastal populations are particularly at risk. Shortages of clean water, extreme flooding, mudslides, higher sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular concern, according to the [Cambodia](4671) Climate Change Alliance. Climate change has also had a major impact on water levels, ecology and productivity of the Tonlé Sap in recent years, affecting the food security and agriculture of a large proportion of [Cambodia](4671)'s population.
[Cambodia](4671) has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from May to October, can see temperatures drop to 22 °C (72 °F) and is generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40 °C (104 °F) around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002, with some degree of flooding almost every year. Severe flooding also affected 17 provinces in [Cambodia](4671) during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season.

[Biodiversity](2966) and conservation
[Cambodia](4671)'s biodiversity is largely founded on its seasonal tropical forests, containing some 180 recorded tree species, and riparian ecosystems. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 240 reptile species, 850 freshwater fish species (Tonle Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species recorded by science. Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere.
The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a reserve surrounding the Tonle Sap lake. It encompasses the lake and nine provinces: Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Banteay Meanchey, Pailin, Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear. In 1997, it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Other key habitats include the evergreen and dry Dipterocarp forests of Mondolkiri province, protected by Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as Ratanakiri province, and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem, including Preah Monivong National Park, Botum-Sakor National Park, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary.
The Worldwide Fund for Nature recognises six distinct terrestrial ecoregions in [Cambodia](4671) – the Cardamom Mountains rain forests, Central Indochina dry forest, Southeast Indochina dry evergreen forest, Southern Annamite Range tropical forest, Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forest, and Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forest.

The rate of deforestation in [Cambodia](4671) is one of the highest in the world and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular environmental issue in the country. [Cambodia](4671)'s primary forest cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. Since 2007, less than 3,220 km2 (1,243 sq mi) of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of [Cambodia](4671) is under severe threat. In 2010–2015, the annual rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental degradation also includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction due to loss of habitats. Reasons for the deforestation in [Cambodia](4671) range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings from big construction projects and agricultural activities. The deforestation involves the local population, [Cambodia](4671)n businesses and authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the world.
Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, by Laos in particular, pose a "real danger to the food supply of Vietnam and [Cambodia](4671). Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that provide the vast majority of [Cambodia](4671)'s protein and could also denude the Mekong River of the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket." The rich fisheries of Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast [Asia](1914), largely supply the impoverished country's protein. The lake is unusual: It all but disappears in the dry season and then expands massively as water flow from the Mekong backs up when the rains come. "Those fish are so important for their livelihoods, both economically and nutritionally", said Gordon Holtgrieve, a professor at the University of Washington; he points out that none of the dams that are either built or being built on the Mekong river "are pointing at good outcomes for the fisheries".
In the 2010s, the [Cambodia](4671)n government and educational system has increased its involvement and co-operation with both national and international environmental groups. A new National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) for [Cambodia](4671) is to be implemented from late 2016 to 2023 and contains new ideas for how to incite a green and environmentally sustainable growth for the country.

Politics
Government
National politics in [Cambodia](4671) take place within the framework of the nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister of [Cambodia](4671), currently Hun Manet, is the head of government, while the King of [Cambodia](4671) (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is the head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly. The prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power.
Legislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral Parliament of [Cambodia](4671) (សភាតំណាងរាស្ត្រ, sâphéa tâmnang réastrâ), which consists of a lower house, the National Assembly (រដ្ឋសភា, rôdthâsâphéa) and an upper house, the Senate (ព្រឹទ្ធសភា, prœ̆tthôsâphéa). Members of the 123-seat National Assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum term of five years. The Senate has 61 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the National Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from the 24 provinces of [Cambodia](4671). Senators serve six-year terms.
On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member Royal Throne Council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.
Officially a multiparty democracy, in reality, "the country remained a one-party state dominated by the [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985. The open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife, Bun Rany", according to Megha Bahree, a writer on Forbes. [Cambodia](4671)'s government has been described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast [Asia](1914)n director, David Roberts, as a "relatively authoritarian coalition via a superficial democracy".
Prime Minister Hun Sen vowed to rule until he turned 74. His government was regularly accused of ignoring human rights and suppressing political dissent. The 2013 election results were disputed by the opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital. Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police. From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took power in 1985, and was by some considered a long-ruling dictator. Hun Sen was succeeded by his son Hun Manet as Prime Minister in August 2023 following an election that was deemed by independent and foreign media and politicians to be neither free nor fair. Hun Sen remains the de facto ruler of [Cambodia](4671) through his continued leadership of the [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party. Following the 2024 Senate election, Hun Sen became president of the Senate, a role which gives him the power to sign off on laws in the King's absence.
Since the 2017 crackdowns on political dissent and free press, [Cambodia](4671) has been described as a de facto one-party state.

Foreign relations
The foreign relations of [Cambodia](4671) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Prak Sokhon. [Cambodia](4671) is a member of the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It is a member of the [Asia](1914)n Development Bank (ADB), [ASEAN](1264), and joined the WTO in 2004. In 2005 [Cambodia](4671) attended the inaugural East [Asia](1914) Summit in Malaysia.
[Cambodia](4671) has established diplomatic relations with numerous countries; the government reports twenty embassies in the country including many of its [Asia](1914)n neighbours and those of important players during the Paris peace negotiations, including the US, [Australia](1659), [Canada](1956), [China](2217), the European Union (EU), Japan, and Russia. As a result of its international relations, various charitable organisations have assisted with social, economic, and civil infrastructure needs.

While the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several border disputes between [Cambodia](4671) and its neighbours persist. There are disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. [Cambodia](4671) and Thailand also have border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a deterioration in relations. Most of the territory belongs to [Cambodia](4671), but a combination of Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai troops upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the [Cambodia](4671)n military have left the situation unsettled since 1962.
[Cambodia](4671) and [China](2217) have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese company with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a deep-water seaport along 90 km (56 mi) stretch of [Cambodia](4671)n coastline of the Gulf of Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently deep to be used by cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. [Cambodia](4671)'s diplomatic support has been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim disputed areas in the South [China](2217) Sea. Because [Cambodia](4671) is a member of [ASEAN](1264), and because under [ASEAN](1264) rules "the objections of one member can thwart any group initiative", [Cambodia](4671) is diplomatically useful to [China](2217) as a counterweight to southeast [Asia](1914)n nations that have closer ties to the [United States](1100).
[Cambodia](4671) is the 70th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.

Military
The Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Army, Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Navy, Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Air Force and Royal Gendarmerie collectively form the Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Armed Forces, under the command of the Ministry of National Defence, presided over by the Prime Minister of [Cambodia](4671). His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the Supreme Commander of the Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Armed Forces (RCAF), and the country's Prime Minister Hun Sen effectively holds the position of commander-in-chief.
The introduction of a revised command structure early in 2000 was a key prelude to the reorganisation of the [Cambodia](4671)n military. This saw the defence ministry form three subordinate general departments responsible for logistics and finance, materials and technical services, and defence services under the High Command Headquarters (HCHQ). The minister of National Defense is General Tea Banh. The Secretaries of State for Defense are Chay Saing Yun and Por Bun Sreu.
In 2010, the Royal [Cambodia](4671)n Armed Forces comprised about 102,000 active personnel (200,000 reserve). Total [Cambodia](4671)n military spending stands at 3% of national GDP. The Royal Gendarmerie of [Cambodia](4671) total more than 7,000 personnel. Its civil duties include providing security and public peace, to investigate and prevent organised crime, terrorism, and other violent groups; to protect state and private property; to help and assist civilians and other emergency forces in a case of emergency, natural disaster, civil unrest, and armed conflicts.
Hun Sen has accumulated highly centralised power in [Cambodia](4671), including a praetorian guard that 'appears to rival the capabilities of the country's regular military units', and is allegedly used by Hun Sen to quell political opposition.' [Cambodia](4671) signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

Political culture
The [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party (CPP) is the sole dominant-party in [Cambodia](4671). The CPP currently commands 120 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly and 55 of 62 seats in the Senate.
Hun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed necessary. In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested, tortured, and some summarily executed.
In addition to political oppression, the [Cambodia](4671)n government has been accused of corruption in the sale of vast areas of land to foreign investors resulting in the eviction of thousands of villagers as well as taking bribes in exchange for grants to exploit [Cambodia](4671)'s oil wealth and mineral resources. [Cambodia](4671) is consistently listed as one of the most corrupt governments in the world. [Amnesty International](4628) currently recognises one prisoner of conscience in the country: 33-year-old land rights activist Yorm Bopha.
Journalists covering a protest over disputed election results in Phnom Penh on 22 September 2013 say they were deliberately attacked by police and men in plain clothes, with slingshots and stun guns. The attack against the president of the Overseas Press Club of [Cambodia](4671), Rick Valenzuela, was captured on video.
The violence came amid political tensions as the opposition boycotted the opening of Parliament due to concerns about electoral fraud. Seven reporters sustained minor injuries while at least two [Cambodia](4671)n protesters were hit by slingshot projectiles and hospitalized.
In 2017, [Cambodia](4671)'s Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition party, [Cambodia](4671) National Rescue Party (CNRP), paving the way for a return to a yet more authoritarian political system.

Corruption
The level of corruption in [Cambodia](4671) exceeds most countries in the world. Despite adopting an 'Anti-Corruption Law' in 2010, corruption prevails throughout the country. Corruption affects the judiciary, the police, and other state institutions. Favouritism by government officials and impunity is commonplace. Lack of a clear distinction between the courts and the executive branch of government also makes for a deep politicisation of the judicial system.
Examples of areas where [Cambodia](4671)ns encounter corrupt practices in their everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with alleged traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts. Companies deal with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially construction-related permits, and the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provided no protection to whistle-blowers, and whistle-blowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.

Legal profession
The [Cambodia](4671)n legal profession was established in 1932. By 1978, due to the Khmer Rouge regime, the entire legal system was eradicated. Judges and lawyers were executed after being deemed "class enemies" and only 6–12 legal professionals actually survived and remained in the country. Lawyers did not reappear until 1995 when the Bar Association of the Kingdom of [Cambodia](4671) was created.

Human rights
A US State Department report says "forces under Hun Sen and the [Cambodia](4671)n People's Party have committed frequent and large-scale abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture, with impunity". According to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 256,800 people are enslaved in modern-day [Cambodia](4671), or 1.65% of the population.
Forced land evictions by senior officials, security forces, and government-connected business leaders are commonplace in [Cambodia](4671). Land has been confiscated from hundreds of thousands of [Cambodia](4671)ns over more than a decade for the purpose of self-enrichment and maintaining power of various groups of special interests. Credible non-governmental organisations estimate that "770,000 people have been adversely affected by land grabbing covering at least four million hectares (nearly 10 million acres) of land that have been confiscated", says Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).
On 14 March 2018, the UN expert on the human rights situation in [Cambodia](4671) "expressed serious concerns about restrictions on the media, freedom of expression and political participation ahead of a national election in July". Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic in [Cambodia](4671).

Administrative divisions
The autonomous municipality (reach thani) and provinces (khaet) of [Cambodia](4671) are first-level administrative divisions. [Cambodia](4671) is divided into 25 provinces including the autonomous municipality.
Municipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of [Cambodia](4671). The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (khum) and quarters (sangkat).

Economy
In 2017 [Cambodia](4671)'s per capita income is $4,022 in PPP and $1,309 in nominal per capita. The United Nations designates [Cambodia](4671) as a least developed country. Most rural households depend on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments, and rubber are [Cambodia](4671)'s major exports. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to [Cambodia](4671) from its rice seed bank in the Philippines. These varieties had been collected in the 1960s.
Based on the Economist, IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period 2001–2010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with the highest annual average GDP growth. Tourism was [Cambodia](4671)'s fastest-growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to over 2 million in 2007. In 2004, inflation was at 1.7% and exports at US$1.6 billion.

Oil and natural gas deposits found beneath [Cambodia](4671)'s territorial waters in 2005 yield great potential but remain mostly untapped, due in part to territorial disputes with Thailand.

The National Bank of [Cambodia](4671) is the central bank of the kingdom and provides regulatory oversight to the country's banking sector and is responsible in part for increasing the foreign direct investment in the country. Between 2010 and 2012 the number of regulated banks and micro-finance institutions increased from 31 covered entities to over 70 individual institutions underlining the growth within the [Cambodia](4671)n banking and finance sector.
In 2012, Credit Bureau [Cambodia](4671) was established with direct regulatory oversight by the National Bank of [Cambodia](4671). The Credit Bureau further increases the transparency and stability within the [Cambodia](4671)n Banking Sector as all banks and microfinance companies are now required by law to report accurate facts and figures relating to loan performance in the country.
One of the largest challenges facing [Cambodia](4671) is still the fact that the older population often lacks education, particularly in the countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged $504 million to the country in 2004, while the [Asia](1914)n Development Bank alone has provided $850 million in loans, grants, and technical assistance. Bribes are often demanded from companies operating in [Cambodia](4671) when obtaining licences and permits, such as construction-related permits.

[Cambodia](4671) ranked among the worst places in the world for organised labour in the 2015 International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Global Rights Index, landing in the category of countries with "no guarantee of rights".'
In April 2016 [Cambodia](4671)'s National Assembly has adopted a Law on Trade Unions. "The law was proposed at a time when workers have been staging sustained protests in factories and in the streets demanding wage increases and improvements in their working conditions". The concerns about [Cambodia](4671)'s new law are shared not only by labour and rights groups but international organisations more generally. The International Labour Organization Country Office for Thailand, [Cambodia](4671) and Lao PDR, has noted that the law has "several key concerns and gaps".

Textiles
The garment industry represents the largest portion of [Cambodia](4671)'s manufacturing sector, accounting for 80% of the country's exports. In 2012, the exports grew to $4.61 billion up 8% over 2011. In the first half of 2013, the garment industry reported exports worth $1.56 billion. The sector employs 335,400 workers, of which 91% are female.
Better Factories [Cambodia](4671) was created in 2001 as a unique partnership between the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. The programme engages with workers, employers, and governments to improve working conditions and boost the competitiveness of the garment industry. On 18 May 2018, the Project Advisory Committee (PAC) of the ILO Better Factories [Cambodia](4671) Programme met in Phnom Penh to provide input into the draft conclusions and recommendations of the BFC's independent mid-term evaluation, as well as to discuss options on how to further strengthen the programme's transparent reporting initiative. The members of the PAC concurred with the findings of the evaluation related to the impact the programme has had on the [Cambodia](4671)n garment sector and workers, including:
a. contributing to sustained overall growth of the garment industry
b. improving the lives of at least half a million [Cambodia](4671)n workers of factories in the BFC
programme and many more of their family members;
c. ensuring that workers receive correct wages and social protection benefits
d. virtually eliminating child labour in the sector
e. making [Cambodia](4671)'s garment factories safer overall
f. creating a "level playing field" for labour across garment sector
g. influencing business practices through (1) using factory data to highlight areas for
improvement and (2) being a core part of risk management strategies of international
brands/buyers.

Tourism
The tourism industry is the country's second-greatest source of hard currency after the textile industry. International visitor arrivals in 2018 topped six million, a ten-fold increase since the beginning of the 21st century. Tourism employs 26% of the country's workforce, which translates into roughly 2.5 million jobs for [Cambodia](4671)ns.
Besides Phom Penh and Angkor Wat, other tourist destinations include Sihanoukville in the southwest which has several popular beaches and Battambang in the northwest, both of which are popular stops for backpackers who make up a significant portion of visitors to [Cambodia](4671). The area around Kampot and Kep including the Bokor Hill Station are also of interest to visitors. Tourism has increased steadily each year in the relatively stable period since the 1993 UNTAC elections.

 Most international arrivals in 2018 were Chinese. Tourism receipts exceeded US$4.4 billion in 2018, accounting for almost ten per cent of the kingdom's gross national product. The Angkor Wat historical park in Siem Reap Province, the beaches in Sihanoukville, the capital city Phnom Penh, and [Cambodia](4671)'s 150 casinos (up from just 57 in 2014) are the main attractions for foreign tourists.
[Cambodia](4671)'s reputation as a safe destination for tourism has been hindered by civil and political unrest  and several high-profile examples of serious crime committed against tourists visiting the kingdom.
[Cambodia](4671)'s tourist souvenir industry employs a lot of people around the main places of interest. The quantity of souvenirs that are produced is not sufficient to face the increasing number of tourists and a majority of products sold to the tourists on the markets are imported from [China](2217), Thailand, and Vietnam.

Agriculture
Agriculture is the mainstay of the [Cambodia](4671)n economy. Agriculture accounted for 90 per cent of GDP in 1985 and employed approximately 80 per cent of the workforce. Rice is the principal commodity. Major secondary crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, soybeans, sesame seeds, dry beans, and rubber. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.

Transport
The civil war and neglect severely damaged [Cambodia](4671)'s transport system. With assistance from other countries, [Cambodia](4671) has been upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved.
[Cambodia](4671) has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometres (380 miles) of single, one-metre (3-foot-3-inch) gauge track. The lines run from the capital to Sihanoukville on the southern coast. Trains are again running to and from the [Cambodia](4671)n capital and popular destinations in the south. After 14 years, regular rail services between the two cities restarted recently – offering a safer option than road for travellers. Trains also run from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (although trains often run only as far as Battambang). As of 1987, only one passenger train per week operated between Phnom Penh and Battambang but a US$141 million project, funded mostly by the [Asia](1914)n Development Bank, has been started to revitalise the languishing rail system that will "(interlink) [Cambodia](4671) with major industrial and logistics centers in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City".
Besides the main inter-provincial traffic artery connecting Phnom Penh with Sihanoukville, resurfacing a former dirt road with concrete/asphalt and bridging five major river crossings have now permanently connected Phnom Penh with Koh Kong, and hence there is now uninterrupted road access to neighbouring Thailand and its road network.

[Cambodia](4671)'s road traffic accident rate is high by world standards. In 2004, the number of road fatalities per 10,000 vehicles was ten times higher in [Cambodia](4671) than in the developed world, and the number of road deaths had doubled in the preceding three years.
[Cambodia](4671)'s extensive inland waterways were important historically in international trade. The Mekong and the Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometres (2,300 miles) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 metres (2.0 feet) and another 282 kilometres (175 miles) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 metres (5.9 feet).
[Cambodia](4671) has two major ports, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, at the junction of the Bassac, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap Rivers, is the only river port capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season.
With increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile use, though motorcycles still predominate. "Cyclo" (as hand-me-down French) or Cycle rickshaws were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques (carriages attached to motorcycles) and rickshaws imported from [India](2798). Cyclos are unique to [Cambodia](4671) in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger seat.
[Cambodia](4671) has three commercial airports. In 2018, they handled a record of 10 million passengers. Phnom Penh International Airport is the busiest airport in [Cambodia](4671). Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is the second busiest, and serves the most international flights in and out of [Cambodia](4671). Sihanouk International Airport, is in the coastal city of Sihanoukville. Techo International Airport, intended to replace the existing Phnom Penh International Airport as the city's main airport, is currently under construction.

Science and technology
A National Committee for Science and Technology representing 11 ministries has been in place since 1999. Although seven ministries are responsible for the country's 33 public universities, the majority of these institutions come under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports.
In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports approved a Policy on Research Development in the Education Sector. This move represented the first step towards a national approach to research and development across the university sector and the application of research for the purposes of national development.
This policy was followed by the country's first National Science and Technology Master Plan 2014–2020. It was officially launched by the Ministry of Planning in December 2014, as the culmination of a two-year process supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The plan makes provision for establishing a science and technology foundation to promote industrial innovation, with a particular focus on agriculture, primary industry and ICTs. [Cambodia](4671) was ranked 103rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

Energy
[Cambodia](4671) has high potential for developing renewable energy resources. Even though the country has not attracted much international investment in renewable energy by 2020, the country serves as a model to learn from for other [ASEAN](1264) countries in terms of conducting solar power auctions. To attract more investment in renewable energy, the government could improve renewable energy governance, adopt clear targets, develop an effective regulatory framework, improve project bankability and facilitate market entry for international investors. [Cambodia](4671) is highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change and it is advised that the country focuses more on developing renewable energy as part of climate change mitigation measures.

Demographics
The French protectorate of [Cambodia](4671) condudcted its first official census in 1921. Only men aged 20 to 60 were counted, as its purpose was for the collection of taxes. After the 1962 population census was conducted, [Cambodia](4671)'s civil conflicts and instability lead to a 36-year-long gap before the country could have another official census in 1998.
As of 2010, half of the [Cambodia](4671)n population is younger than 22 years old. At a 1.04 female to male ratio, [Cambodia](4671) has the most female-biased sex ratio in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Among the [Cambodia](4671)n population aged over 65, the female to male ratio is 1.6:1.
The total fertility rate in [Cambodia](4671) was 2.5 children per woman in 2018.
The fertility rate was 4.0 children in 2000. Women in urban areas have 2.2 children on average, compared with 3.3 children per woman in rural areas. Fertility is highest in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri Provinces, where women have an average of 4.5 children, and lowest in Phnom Penh where women have an average of 2.0 children.

Ethnic groups
The vast majority of [Cambodia](4671)'s population is of ethnic Khmer origin (95.8%) who are speakers of the Khmer language, the country's sole official language. [Cambodia](4671)'s population is largely homogeneous. Its minority groups include Chams (1.8%), Vietnamese (0.5%) and Chinese (0.6%).
The largest ethnic group, the Khmers are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos, and [Cambodia](4671) meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.
The Vietnamese are the second-largest ethnic minority in [Cambodia](4671), with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese language has been determined to be a Mon–Khmer language, there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the [India](2798)n cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of the Chinese cultural sphere. Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese can be traced to the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor [Cambodia](4671), and effectively dominate all of Indochina.
Chinese [Cambodia](4671)ns are approximately 0.6% of the population. Most Chinese are descended from 19th–20th-century settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.
The indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning "Highland Khmer". They are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon–Khmer speakers via southern [China](2217) and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast [Asia](1914). Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not [India](2798)nized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many pre-[India](2798)n-contact customs and beliefs.
The Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in [Cambodia](4671) number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country. Almost all Cham in [Cambodia](4671) are Muslims.

Largest cities
Languages
The Khmer language is a member of the Mon–Khmer subfamily of the Austroasiatic language group. French, once the language of government in Indochina, is still spoken by many older [Cambodia](4671)ns, and is also the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded by the government of France. There is also a French-language newspaper and some TV channels are available in French. [Cambodia](4671) is a member of La Francophonie. [Cambodia](4671)n French, a remnant of the country's colonial past, is a dialect found in [Cambodia](4671) and is sometimes used in government, particularly in court. Since 1993, there has been a growing use of English, which has been replacing French as the main foreign language. English is widely taught in several universities and there is also a significant press in that language, while street signs are now bilingual in Khmer and English. Due to this shift, mostly English is now used in [Cambodia](4671)'s international relationships, and it has replaced French both on [Cambodia](4671)'s stamps and, since 2002, on [Cambodia](4671)n currency.
The Khmer script is derived from the South [India](2798)n Pallava script.

Religion
Theravada Buddhism is the official religion of [Cambodia](4671), practised by more than 95 per cent of the population with an estimated 4,392 monastery temples throughout the country. [Cambodia](4671)n Buddhism is deeply influenced by Hinduism and native animism.
The close interrelationship between spirits and the community, the efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms, and the possibility of manipulating one's life through contact with spiritual entities such as the "baromey" spirits originates from the native folk religion. Hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices of Tantricism and a host of Hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit world (for example, the important neak ta spirit called Yeay Mao is the modern avatar of the Hindu goddess Kali).
Mahayana Buddhism is the religion of the majority of Chinese and Vietnamese in [Cambodia](4671). Elements of other religious practices, such as the veneration of folk heroes and ancestors, Confucianism, and Taoism mix with Chinese Buddhism are also practised.
Islam is followed by about 2% of the population and comes in three varieties, two practised by the Cham people and a third by the descendants of Malays, resident in the country for generations. [Cambodia](4671)'s Muslim population is reported to be 80% ethnic Cham.

Health
[Cambodia](4671)n life expectancy was 75 years in 2021, a major improvement since 1995 when the average life expectancy was 55. Health care is offered by both public and private practitioners and research has found that trust in health providers is a key factor in improving the uptake of health care services in rural [Cambodia](4671). The government plans to increase the quality of healthcare in the country by raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.
[Cambodia](4671)'s infant mortality rate has decreased from 86 per 1,000 live births in 1998 to 24 in 2018.
In the province with worst health indicators, Ratanakiri, 22.9% of children die before age five.
[Cambodia](4671) was once one of the most landmined countries in the world. According to some estimates, unexploded land mines have been responsible for over 60,000 civilian deaths and thousands more maimed or injured since 1970. The number of reported landmine casualties has sharply decreased, from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 (22 dead and 89 injured). Adults that survive landmines often require amputation of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival. [Cambodia](4671) is expected to be free of land mines by 2025 but the social and economic legacy, including orphans and one in 290 people being an amputee, is expected to affect [Cambodia](4671) for years to come.
In [Cambodia](4671), landmines and exploded ordnance alone have caused 44,630 injuries between 1979 and 2013, according to the [Cambodia](4671) Mine/UXO Victim Information System.

Education
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for establishing national policies and guidelines for education in [Cambodia](4671). The [Cambodia](4671)n education system is heavily decentralised, with three levels of government, central, provincial, and district – responsible for its management. The constitution of [Cambodia](4671) promulgates free compulsory education for nine years, guaranteeing the universal right to basic quality education.

The 2019 [Cambodia](4671)n census estimated that 88.5% of the population was literate (91.1% of men and 86.2% of women). Male youth age (15–24 years) have a literacy rate of 89% compared to 86% for females.
The education system in [Cambodia](4671) continues to face many challenges, but during the past years, there have been significant improvements, especially in terms of primary net enrolment gains, the introduction of program based-budgeting, and the development of a policy framework which helps disadvantaged children to gain access to education. The country has also significantly invested in vocational education, especially in rural areas, to tackle poverty and unemployment.
 Two of [Cambodia](4671)'s most acclaimed universities are based in Phnom Penh.
Traditionally, education in [Cambodia](4671) was offered by the wats (Buddhist temples), thus providing education exclusively for the male population. During the Khmer Rouge regime, education suffered significant setbacks. Education has also suffered setbacks from child labour, A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in [Cambodia](4671) are enrolled in school but their employment is associated with late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes, and increased drop out rates. With respect to academic performance among [Cambodia](4671)n primary school children, research showed that parental attitudes and beliefs played a significant role.

Crime
In 2017, [Cambodia](4671) had a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 population.
Prostitution is illegal in [Cambodia](4671) but yet appears to be prevalent. In a series of 1993 interviews of women about prostitution, three quarters of the interviewees found being a prostitute to be a norm and a profession they felt was not shameful having. That same year, it was estimated that there were about 100,000 sex workers in [Cambodia](4671).
On 18 August 2019, Prime Minister Hun Sen signed a directive banning the Finance Ministry from issuing new online gambling licenses, while operators currently holding online licenses would only be allowed to continue operating until those licenses expire. The directive cited the fact that "some foreigners have used this form of gambling to cheat victims inside and outside the country" as justifying the new policy. [Cambodia](4671) had issued over 150 such licenses before the new policy was announced.

Culture
Various factors contribute to the [Cambodia](4671)n culture including Theravada Buddhism, Hinduism, French colonialism, Angkorian culture, and modern globalization. The [Cambodia](4671)n Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is responsible for promoting and developing [Cambodia](4671)n culture. [Cambodia](4671)n culture not only includes the culture of the lowland ethnic majority, but also some 20 culturally distinct hill tribes colloquially known as the Khmer Loeu, a term coined by Norodom Sihanouk to encourage unity between the highlanders and lowlanders.
Rural [Cambodia](4671)ns wear a krama scarf which is a unique aspect of [Cambodia](4671)n clothing. The sampeah is a traditional [Cambodia](4671)n greeting or a way of showing respect to others. Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture, and sculpture, which have been exchanged with neighbouring Laos and Thailand throughout history. Angkor Wat (Angkor means "city" and Wat means "temple") is the best-preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era along with hundreds of other temples that have been discovered in and around the region.
Traditionally, the Khmer people have a recorded information on Tra leaves. Tra leaf books record legends of the Khmer people, the Ramayana, the origin of Buddhism and other prayer books. They are taken care of by wrapping in cloth to protect from moisture and the climate.

Bon Om Touk ([Cambodia](4671)n Water & Moon Festival), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended [Cambodia](4671)n national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong River begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of [Cambodia](4671)'s population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, dine, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere.
Popular games include soccer, kicking a sey, which is similar to a footbag, and chess. Based on the classical [India](2798)n solar calendar and Theravada Buddhism, the [Cambodia](4671)n New Year is a major holiday that takes place in April. Recent artistic figures include singers Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea (and later Preap Sovath and Sokun Nisa), who introduced new musical styles to the country.
Every year, [Cambodia](4671)ns visit pagodas across the country to mark the Pchum Ben (Ancestors' Day). During the 15-day festival, people offer prayers and food to the spirits of their dead relatives. For most [Cambodia](4671)ns, it is a time to remember their relatives who died during the 1975–1979 Khmer Rouge regime.

Cuisine
Rice is the staple grain, as in other Southeast [Asia](1914)n countries. Fish from the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers is also an important part of the diet. The supply of fish and fish products for food and trade as of 2000 was 20 kilograms (44 pounds) per person or 2 ounces per day per person. Some of the fish can be made into prahok for longer storage.
The cuisine of [Cambodia](4671) contains tropical fruits, soups and noodles. Key ingredients are kaffir lime, lemon grass, garlic, fish sauce, soy sauce, tamarind, ginger, oyster sauce, coconut milk and black pepper. Some delicacies are num banhchok (នំបញ្ចុក), fish amok (អាម៉ុកត្រី) and aping (អាពីង). The country also boasts various distinct local street foods.
French influence on [Cambodia](4671)n cuisine includes the [Cambodia](4671)n red curry with toasted baguette bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the curry and eaten. [Cambodia](4671)n red curry is also eaten with rice and rice vermicelli noodles. Probably the most popular dine out dish, kuyteav, is a pork broth rice noodle soup with fried garlic, scallions, green onions that may also contain various toppings such as beef balls, shrimp, pork liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to be the best in the world and accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks and squid in the restaurants on the Ou Trojak Jet river. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbours Thailand and Vietnam.
[Cambodia](4671)ns drink plenty of tea, grown in Mondulkiri Province and around Kirirom. te krolap is a strong tea, made by putting water and a mass of tea leaves into a small glass, placing a saucer on top, and turning the whole thing upside down to brew. When it is dark enough, the tea is decanted into another cup and plenty of sugar added, but no milk. Lemon tea te kdau kroch chhma, made with Chinese red-dust tea and lemon juice, is refreshing both hot and iced and is generally served with a hefty dose of sugar. Regarding coffee, the beans are generally imported from Laos and Vietnam – although domestically produced coffee from Ratanakiri Province and Mondulkiri Province can be found in some places. Beans are traditionally roasted with butter and sugar, plus various other ingredients that might include anything from rum to pork fat, giving the beverage a strange, sometimes faintly chocolatey aroma.
[Cambodia](4671) has several industrial breweries, located mainly in Sihanoukville Province and Phnom Penh. There are also a growing number of microbreweries in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. As of 2019, there are 12 brewpubs or microbreweries in [Cambodia](4671). Rice wine is a popular alcoholic drink. Its quality varies widely and it is often infused with fruits or medicinal herbs. When prepared with macerated fruits or spices, like the Sombai liqueur, it is called sra tram (soaked wine).

Sports
Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although professional organised sports are not as prevalent in [Cambodia](4671) as in western countries because of the economic conditions. Soccer was brought to [Cambodia](4671) by the French and became popular with the locals. The [Cambodia](4671) national football team managed fourth in the 1972 [Asia](1914)n Cup, but development has slowed since the civil war.
Western sports such as basketball, volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity. Volleyball is by far the most popular sport in the country. Native sports include traditional boat racing, buffalo racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator. [Cambodia](4671) first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. [Cambodia](4671) also hosted the GANEFO Games in 1966 and recently, the SEA Games in 2023.

Dance
[Cambodia](4671)n dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer classical dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of Khmer classical dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms back to the time of Angkor, seeing similarities in the temple engravings of the period, while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s.
Khmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art established in the royal courts of [Cambodia](4671) exhibited for both entertainment and ceremonial purposes. The dances are performed by intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. Known formally as Robam Preah Reach Troap (របាំព្រះរាជទ្រព្យ "theater of royal wealth") it is set to the music of a pinpeat ensemble accompanied by a vocal chorus.
[Cambodia](4671)n folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates the various cultural and ethnic groups of [Cambodia](4671). Folk dances originated in the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for the villagers. The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes, Chams or farmers. Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the "common person" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.
Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of other Southeast [Asia](1914)n nations. Examples include the circle dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam Leav. Modern western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the Madison, have also influenced [Cambodia](4671)n social dance.

Music
Traditional [Cambodia](4671)n music dates back as far as the Khmer Empire. Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the [Cambodia](4671)n culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music include Chapei and Ayai. The former is popular among the older generation and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a [Cambodia](4671)n guitar (chapei) in between a cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme.
A Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and ad-libbed. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, "answering" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. Pleng kaah (lit. "wedding music") is a set of traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding.
[Cambodia](4671)n popular music is performed with western style instruments or a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Sereysothea, and Pen Ran from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of [Cambodia](4671). During the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge. and many original master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed.
In the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the [United States](1100)) and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern instrumentation.
The [Australia](1659)n hip hop group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak Channthy, a native-born [Cambodia](4671)n female singer.
The Dengue Fever rock and roll band features a [Cambodia](4671)n female singer and back-up band from California. It is classified as "world music" and combines [Cambodia](4671)n music with Western-style rock.
