Colcannon
Colcannon (Irish: cál ceannann, meaning 'white-headed cabbage' ˌkaːlˠ ˈcan̪ˠən̪ˠ) is a traditional Irish dish of mashed potatoes with cabbage. It is a popular dish on Saint Patrick's Day and on the feast day of St. Brigid.

Description
Colcannon is most commonly made with only four ingredients: potatoes, butter, milk and cabbage. Irish historian Patrick Weston Joyce defined it as "potatoes mashed with butter and milk, with chopped up cabbage and pot herbs". It can contain other ingredients such as scallions (spring onions), leeks, laverbread, onions and chives. Some recipes substitute cabbage with kale. There are many regional variations of this staple dish. It was a cheap, year-round food. It is often eaten with boiled ham, salt pork or Irish bacon. As a side dish it can be paired with corned beef and cabbage.
Colcannon is similar to champ, a dish made with scallions, butter and milk that is traditionally offered to fairies in a spoon placed at the foot of a hawthorn tree.

Etymology
The origin of the word is unclear. The first syllable "col" likely comes from the Irish "cál," meaning cabbage. The second syllable may derive from "ceann-fhionn," meaning a white head (i.e. "a white head of cabbage."). This usage is also found in the Irish name for a coot, a white-headed bird known as "cearc cheannan" or "white-head hen.". 
In Welsh, the name for leek soup is cawl cennin, a phrase combining cawl meaning "soup", "broth" or "gruel", when it is not a reference to the typical Welsh meat and vegetable stew named in full "cawl Cymreig", with "cennin," the plural of "cenhinen," meaning "leeks".
