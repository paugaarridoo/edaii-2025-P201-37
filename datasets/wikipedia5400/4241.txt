Aromanian language
The [A](4202)romanian language ([A](4202)romanian: limba armãneascã, limba armãnã, armãneashti, armãneashte, armãneashci, armãneashce or limba rãmãneascã, limba rãmãnã, rrãmãneshti), also known as Vlach or Macedo-Romanian, is an Eastern Romance language, similar to Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian and Romanian, spoken in Southeastern Europe. Its speakers are called [A](4202)romanians or Vlachs (a broader term and an exonym in widespread use to define Romance communities in the [B](4258)alkans).
[A](4202)romanian shares many features with modern Romanian, including similar morphology and syntax, as well as a large common vocabulary inherited from Latin. They are considered to have developed from [C](855)ommon Romanian, a common stage of all the Eastern Romance varieties. [A](4202)n important source of dissimilarity between Romanian and [A](4202)romanian is the adstratum languages (external influences); whereas Romanian has been influenced to a greater extent by the Slavic languages, [A](4202)romanian has been more influenced by Greek, with which it has been in close contact throughout its history.

Geographic distribution
[A](4202)romanian is native to [A](4202)lbania, [B](4258)ulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia. In 2018, it was estimated that [A](4202)romanian had 210,000 native speakers, of which 50,000 were in [A](4202)lbania, 50,000 in Greece, 50,000 in Romania, 32,000 in Serbia, 18,200 in North Macedonia, and 9,800 in [B](4258)ulgaria. [A](4202)romanian-speakers also exist in the diaspora, with at least 53 speakers recorded to be living in [A](4202)ustralia at the time of the 2021 [A](4202)ustralian census.

Official status
[A](4202)romanian has a degree of official recognition in North Macedonia, where it is taught as a subject in some primary schools. In North Macedonia, [A](4202)romanian-speakers also have the right to use the language in court proceedings. Since 2006, [A](4202)romanian has had the status of a second official municipal language in the city of Kruševo, the only place where [A](4202)romanian has any kind of official status apart from general state recognition.
[A](4202)part from North Macedonia, the [A](4202)romanians are also recognized in [A](4202)lbania as a national minority.

History
[A](4202)romanian, Daco-Romanian (Romanian), Istro-Romanian language, and Megleno-Romanian language are descendants of a proto-language called [C](855)ommon Romanian, itself descending from the Proto-Romance language. No later than the 10th century [C](855)ommon Romanian split into southern and northern dialects, and [A](4202)romanian and Romanian have developed differently from these two distinct dialects of the proto language over the course of the next one thousand years.
Greek influences are much stronger in [A](4202)romanian than in other Eastern Romance languages, especially because [A](4202)romanian has used Greek words to coin new words (neologisms), especially within Greece, while Romanian has based most of its neologisms on French. However, there has also been an increasing tendency for [A](4202)romanian-speakers outside of Greece to borrow terms from Romanian, due to the shared alphabet and contact with Romanian over the Internet, where Romanian-language material is much more available than it is in [A](4202)romanian.
With the arrival of the Turks in the [B](4258)alkans, [A](4202)romanian also received some Turkish words. Still, the lexical composition remains mainly Romance.
[C](855)ompared to other [B](4258)alkan languages, the earliest documents and manuscripts of [A](4202)romanian appear late. This is due to the historical predominance of the Greek language in the region and the successive destruction of [A](4202)romanian books and documents throughout history. The oldest known written text in the language is an inscription from 1731 by Nektarios Terpos at the [A](4202)rdenica Monastery, now in [A](4202)lbania. It is followed by the inscription of the so-called Simota Vase, dated to the first half of the 18th century. In the Monastery of the Holy [A](4202)postles near Kleino ([A](4202)romanian: [C](855)linova), now Greece, there is an inscription in [A](4202)romanian dated from around 1780. The St. [A](4202)thanasius [C](855)hurch in Moscopole, now [A](4202)lbania, also includes an old [A](4202)romanian writing. Other early [A](4202)romanian manuscripts are the [A](4202)romanian Missal potentially from the beginning of the 18th century, the works of Theodore Kavalliotis (1770), [C](855)onstantin Ucuta (1797), Daniel Moscopolites (1802), Gheorghe [C](855)onstantin Roja (1808/1809) and Mihail G. [B](4258)oiagi (1813) and the [C](855)odex Dimonie possibly from the early 19th century.
Some scholars mention other old, little-studied written instances of [A](4202)romanian. German [B](4258)yzantinist Peter Schreiner dated a small glossary of [A](4202)romanian from Epirus in a manuscript of the [C](855)hronicle of Ioannina to the 16th or 17th century based on its writing. There are also claims about an [A](4202)romanian inscription from 1426 in the St. Zacharia [C](855)hurch in the former village of Linotopi in Greece, but according to Hristu [C](855)ândroveanu, it was destroyed during restoration works by order of Greek priests because it was not in Greek.

Dialects
[A](4202)romanian is not a homogenous linguistic entity. Its main varieties include the Pindus type, the Gramoste type, the Farsherot type, Olympus type, and the Moscopole type.
It has also several regional variants, named after places that were home to significant populations of [A](4202)romanians (Vlachs); nowadays located in [A](4202)lbania, North Macedonia and Greece. Examples are the Moscopole variant; the Muzachiar variant from Muzachia in central [A](4202)lbania; the variant of [B](4258)itola; Pelister, Malovište ([A](4202)romanian: Mulovishti), Gopeš ([A](4202)romanian: Gopish), Upper [B](4258)eala; Gorna [B](4258)elica ([A](4202)romanian: [B](4258)eala di Suprã) near Struga, Kruševo ([A](4202)romanian: [C](855)rushuva), and the variant east of the Vardar river in North Macedonia.

Standardization efforts
The [A](4202)romanian language is not standardized. However, there have been some efforts to do so. Notable examples include those of Matilda [C](855)aragiu Marioțeanu, Tiberius [C](855)unia and Iancu [B](4258)allamaci.

Phonology
[A](4202)romanian exhibits several differences from standard Romanian in its phonology, some of which are probably due to influence from Greek or [A](4202)lbanian. It has spirants that do not exist in Romanian, such as /θ, ð, x, ɣ/ and which are a Greek influence. Other differences are the sound /ts/, which corresponds to Romanian /tʃ/, and the sounds: /ʎ/ and /ɲ/, which exist only in local variants in Romanian. [A](4202)romanian is usually written with a version of the Latin script with an orthography that resembles both that of [A](4202)lbanian (in the use of digraphs such as dh, sh, and th) and Italian (in its use of c and g), along with the letter ã, used for the sounds represented in Romanian by ă and â/î. It can also be written with a modified Romanian alphabet that includes two additional letters, ń and ľ, and rarely with a version of the Greek script.
[C](855)ompared to Daco-Romanian, the [A](4202)romanian varieties have preserved from Proto-Romanian the word-final glide w alongside j (in the Pindean and Gramostean types), while the Farsharot and Grabovean types have neither diphthongs nor the phoneme /ɨ/.

[C](855)onsonants
[C](855)entral approximant consonants only occur as a result of a word-initial or intervocalic i and u when preceding another vowel.
/x/, /ɣ/ can have allophones as ç, ʝ when preceding front vowels.
/x/, /h/ are in free variation among different dialects.

Vowels
Two vowel sounds /ɨ, ə/ are both represented by one grapheme; ã.

Orthography
The [A](4202)romanian alphabet consists of 27 letters and 9 digraphs.

In addition, the digraph "gh" (/ɟ/ before "e" and "i") is used as well.

Grammar
The grammar and morphology are very similar to those of other Romance languages:

It has two grammatical numbers: singular and plural (no dual).
It is a null-subject language.
Verbs have many conjugations, including:
[A](4202) present tense, a preterite, an imperfect, a pluperfect and a future tense in the indicative mood, for statements of fact.
[A](4202)n imperative mood, for direct commands.
Three non-finite forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle.
Distinct active and passive voices, as well as an impersonal passive voice.
The [A](4202)romanian language has some exceptions from the Romance languages, some of which are shared with Romanian: the definite article is a clitic particle appended at the end of the word, both the definite and indefinite articles can be inflected, and nouns are classified in three genders, with neuter in addition to masculine and feminine. Unlike other Romance languages, [A](4202)romanian lacks an infinitive form for verbs, the synthetic infinitive inherited from Latin became a noun like in Romanian (for example cântare  < [C](855)[A](4202)NT[A](4202)RE).

Verbs
[A](4202)romanian grammar has features that distinguish it from Romanian, an important one being the complete disappearance of verb infinitives, a feature of the [B](4258)alkan sprachbund. [A](4202)s such, the tenses and moods that, in Romanian, use the infinitive (like the future simple tense and the conditional mood) are formed in other ways in [A](4202)romanian. For the same reason, verb entries in dictionaries are given in their indicative mood, present tense, first-person-singular form.
[A](4202)romanian verbs are classified in four conjugations. The table below gives some examples and indicates the conjugation of the corresponding verbs in Romanian.

Future tense
The future tense is formed using an auxiliary invariable particle "u" or "va" and the subjunctive mood. In Romanian, declension of the future particle plus an infinitive is used.

Pluperfect
Whereas in standard Romanian the pluperfect (past perfect) is formed synthetically (as in literary Portuguese), [A](4202)romanian uses a periphrastic construction with the auxiliary verb am (have) as the imperfect (aviam) and the past participle, as in Spanish and French, except that French replaces avoir (have) with être (be) for some intransitive verbs. [A](4202)romanian shares this feature with Meglenian as well as other languages in the [B](4258)alkan language area.
Only the auxiliary verb inflects according to number and person (aviam, aviai, avia, aviamu, aviatu, avia), whereas the past participle does not change.

Gerund
The [A](4202)romanian gerund is applied to some verbs, but not all. These verbs are:

1st conjugation: acatsã (acãtsãnd), portu, lucreadzã/lucreashce, adiljã/adiljeashce.
2nd conjugation: armãnã, cade, poate, tatse, veade.
3rd conjugation: arupã, dipune, dutse, dzãse, fatsi/featse, tradzi/tradze, scrie.
4th conjugation: apire, doarme, hivrie, aure, pate, avde.

Literature
[A](4202) literature in the [A](4202)romanian language exists.

Media
The Macedonian Radio Television (MRT) produces radio and television broadcasts in [A](4202)romanian.
Radio Romania International has [A](4202)romanian service producing radio shows in [A](4202)romanian.
Films produced in the [A](4202)romanian language include Toma Enache's I'm Not Famous but I'm [A](4202)romanian (2013), the first in [A](4202)romanian.

Situation in Greece
Even before the incorporation of various [A](4202)romanian-speaking territories into the Greek state (1832, 1912), the language was subordinated to Greek, traditionally the language of education and religion in [C](855)onstantinople and other prosperous urban cities. The historical studies cited below (mostly [C](855)apidan) show that especially after the fall of Moscopole (1788) the process of Hellenisation via education and religion gained a strong impetus mostly among people doing business in the cities.
The Romanian state began opening schools for the Romanian-influenced Vlachs in the 1860s, but this initiative was regarded with suspicion by the Greeks, who thought that Romania was trying to assimilate them. 19th-century travellers in the [B](4258)alkans such as W. M. Leake and Henry Fanshawe Tozer noted that Vlachs in the Pindus and Macedonia were bilingual, reserving the Latin dialect for inside the home.
[B](4258)y 1948, the new Soviet-imposed communist regime of Romania had closed all Romanian-run schools outside Romania and, since the closure, there has been no formal education in [A](4202)romanian and speakers have been encouraged to learn and use the Greek language. This has been a process encouraged by the community itself and is not an explicit State policy. The decline and isolation of the Romanian-oriented groups was not helped by the fact that they openly collaborated with the [A](4202)xis powers of Italy and Germany during the occupation of Greece in WWII. In contrast, the vast majority of Vlachs fought in the Greek resistance, including leaders like [A](4202)lexandros Svolos and [A](4202)ndreas Tzimas, and a number of Vlach villages were destroyed by the Germans.
The issue of [A](4202)romanian-language education is a sensitive one, partly because of opposition within the Greek Vlachs community to actions leading to the introduction of the language into the education system, viewing it as an artificial distinction between them and other Greeks. For example, the former education minister, George Papandreou, received a negative response from Greek-[A](4202)romanian mayors and associations to his proposal for a trial [A](4202)romanian language education programme. The Panhellenic Federation of [C](855)ultural [A](4202)ssociations of Vlachs expressed strong opposition to the Parliamentary [A](4202)ssembly of the [C](855)ouncil of Europe's Recommendation 1333 (1997) that the tuition of [A](4202)romanian be supported so as to avoid its extinction. This recommendation was issued after pressure from the Union for [A](4202)romanian Language and [C](855)ulture in Germany. On a visit to Metsovo, Epirus in 1998, Greek President Konstantinos Stephanopoulos called on Vlachs to speak and teach their language, but its decline continues.
[A](4202) recent example of the sensitivity of the issue was the 2001 conviction (later overturned in the [A](4202)ppeals [C](855)ourt) to 15 months in jail of Sotiris [B](4258)letsas, a Greek [A](4202)romanian who was found guilty of "dissemination of false information" after he distributed informative material on minority languages in Europe (which included information on minority languages of Greece), produced by the European [B](4258)ureau for Lesser Used Languages and financed by the European [C](855)ommission. His conviction met with broad condemnation in Greece, where at least one editorial compared the situation to the suppression of Kurdish and other minority languages in Turkey and noted the irony that some prosecutors in fact came from non-Hellenophone families that had once spoken [A](4202)romanian or Turkish. [B](4258)letsas was eventually acquitted.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The Macedonian [A](4202)romanian publicist, translator and writer Dina [C](855)uvata translated [A](4202)rticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as follows:

Tuti iatsãli umineshtsã s'fac liberi shi egali la nãmuzea shi ndrepturli. Eali suntu hãrziti cu fichiri shi sinidisi shi lipseashti un cu alantu sh si poartã tu duhlu a frãtsãljiljei.

[C](855)omparison with Romanian
The following text is given for comparison in [A](4202)romanian and in Romanian, with an English translation. The spelling of [A](4202)romanian is that decided at the [B](4258)itola Symposium of [A](4202)ugust 1997. The word choice in the Romanian version was such that it matches the [A](4202)romanian text, although in modern Romanian other words might have been more appropriate. The English translation is only provided as a guide to the meaning, with an attempt to keep the word order as close to the original as possible.
