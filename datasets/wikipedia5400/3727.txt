3727
Ahhotep II
[Ahhotep I](3726)I was an ancient [Egypt](1987)ian queen, and likely the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Kamose.

Different Ahhoteps
The naming / numbering by [Egypt](1987)ologists of the queens named Ahhotep has changed during the years.
During the late nineteenth century, [Egypt](1987)ologists thought that [Ahhotep I](3726) was the wife of Seqenenre Tao. The coffins of Deir el-Bahari and Dra' Abu el-Naga' were both thought by some experts to be hers. Also, [Ahhotep I](3726)I was thought to be the wife of [Amenhotep I](3766) as the coffin from the Deir el-Bahari cache was considered to belong to a queen called [Ahhotep I](3726)I.
During the 1970s, it was noted that the Deir el-Bahari coffin bears the title King's Mother yet [Amenhotep I](3766) had no son. Therefore, the title must refer to the mother of [Ahmose I](3733). In 1982, Robins suggested that [Ahhotep I](3726) was the occupant of the gilded coffin from Dra' Abu el-Naga'.  [Ahhotep I](3726)I is the queen mentioned on the Deir el-Bahari coffin and [Ahhotep I](3726)II is the Queen mentioned on the statue of a prince Ahmose.
Following Dodson and Hilton (2004), it is now considered that [Ahhotep I](3726) was the wife of Seqenenre Tao and the mother of [Ahmose I](3733). [Ahhotep I](3726)I is now regarded as the queen identified from the gilded coffin found at Dra' Abu el-Naga' and, therefore, possibly a wife of Kamose. It is no longer considered that there was a queen called [Ahhotep I](3726)II.
This interpretation by Dodson and Hilton has been used in this article.

Family
[Ahhotep I](3726)I is thought to be the wife of Kamose and possibly the mother of Queen [Ahmose-Sitkamose](3731). It is possible that [Ahhotep I](3726)I is identical to a queen known as [Ahhotep I](3726). If so, she may have been married to Seqenenre Tao instead.
The title of King's Mother is only found on the coffin from Deir el Bahari and not on the funerary equipment from Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It could be argued that [Ahhotep I](3726)I was a royal wife but never the mother of a pharaoh, and hence not the same person as [Ahhotep I](3726).

Burial
[Ahhotep I](3726)I was buried in Dra' Abu el-Naga' and rediscovered in February 1859 by workmen employed by Auguste Mariette. The tomb contained her mummy (destroyed in 1859) and gold and silver jewelry. An inscribed ceremonial axe blade made of copper, gold, electrum and wood was decorated with a Minoan style griffin. Three golden flies were included and were awards usually given to people who served and acquitted themselves well in the army. A few items bore the name of Kamose, but more were inscribed with the name of [Ahmose I](3733).

The Dra' Abu el-Naga' coffin and the items associated with it all have inscriptions using an early form of the Iah glyph. The representation of the hieroglyph changed between years 18 and 22 of [Ahmose I](3733). The use of the early form of Iah suggests that Queen [Ahhotep I](3726)I died sometime before year 20 of [Ahmose I](3733). This suggests that this queen is not Ahhotep, mother of Ahmose, because that queen appears on a stela dated to [Amenhotep I](3766) and possibly survived into the reign of Thutmose I.

Alternative theory
An alternative interpretation has been developed by Ann Macy Roth. In this interpretation, the pharaoh Seqenenre Tao had three queen consorts:

[Ahhotep I](3726), who was the mother of a prince named Ahmose (not the future pharaoh) and several princesses named Ahmose.
Sitdjehuti, who was the mother of a princess named Ahmose.
Tetisheri, who was the mother of Kamose, [Ahhotep I](3726)I and [Ahmose-Henuttamehu](3728).
Kamose married his sister [Ahhotep I](3726)I and were then the parents of [Ahmose I](3733), [Ahmose-Nefertari](3730) and [Ahmose-Sitkamose](3731).
