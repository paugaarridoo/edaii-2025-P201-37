Baltimore accent
A [Baltimore](3179) accent, also known as [Baltimore](3179)se and sometimes humorously spelled Bawlmerese or Ballimorese, is an accent or sub-variety of Delaware Valley English (a dialect whose largest hub is Philadelphia) that originates among blue-collar residents of [Baltimore](3179), Maryland, United States. It extends into the [Baltimore](3179) metropolitan area and northeastern Maryland.
At the same time, there is considerable linguistic diversity within [Baltimore](3179), which complicates the notion of a singular "[Baltimore](3179) accent". According to linguists, the accent of white blue-collar [Baltimore](3179)ans is different than the [African-American Vernacular English](4417) accent of black [Baltimore](3179)ans. White working-class families who migrated out of [Baltimore](3179) to the northwestern suburbs brought local pronunciations with them.

Pronunciation
The [Baltimore](3179) accent that originated among white blue-collar residents closely resembles blue-collar Philadelphia-area English pronunciation in many ways. These two cities are the only major ports on the Eastern Seaboard never to have developed non-rhotic speech among European American speakers; they were greatly influenced in their early development by Hiberno-English, Scottish English, and West Country English. Due to the significant similarity between the speeches of [Baltimore](3179), Philadelphia, Delaware and southern New Jersey, sociolinguists refer to them collectively as the Mid-Atlantic regional dialect. In [Baltimore](3179) accents, sounds around /r/ are often "smoothed" or elided. For example, a word like bureau is commonly pronounced /ˈbiroʊ/ (e.g., Federal Beer-o of Investigation) and mirror is commonly pronounced /mir/ ("mere"); the related mare–mayor merger also exists.

Vowels
Several vowels undergo fronting.  fronts to ɛɔ or æɔ.  fronts to ʉu. Similarly,  shifts to əʊ or even eʊ. When word-final and spelled as -ow, it is pronounced like /ə/, resulting in colloquial or humorous spellings like pilla for pillow and winda for window.
No cot–caught merger: The words cot /ɑ/ and caught /ɔ/ do not rhyme, with the latter vowel maintaining a raised position. Likewise, the word on rhymes with dawn and not don.
As in Philadelphia, the word water is often pronounced as wooder ˈwʊɾɚ or, more uniquely, warter ˈwɔɻɾɚ.
As in most Mid-Atlantic cities, short a is pronounced with a phonemic split: for example, the word sad /sæd/ does not rhyme with the word mad /meəd/. Pronunciation is dependent upon a complex system of rules that differ from city to city. [Baltimore](3179) follows the Philadelphia pattern. For more details on the Philadelphia, New York, and [Baltimore](3179) systems see /æ/ raising.

The /ɑr/ vowel in words like start is often raised and backed, resulting in a vowel close to /ɔ/. Likewise, /ɔr/ as in bore can shift as high as /ʊr/ as in boor. This pattern has also been noted to occur in Philadelphia and New York.
Canadian raising occurs for  before voiceless consonants, as in Philadelphia; for instance, the word like ɫʌɪk begins with a higher nucleus than live ɫaɪv.
On the other hand,  may undergo smoothing before liquids, becoming ɑ before /r/ and /l/; e.g., fire is pronounced as fɑɻ, in which a popular [Baltimore](3179) Christmas joke: "Why were the Three Wise Men covered with soot?" "Because they came from afar."
ə is often eliminated entirely from a word when before a consonant; e.g. Annapolis = Naplis, cigarette = cigrette, company = compny, Italy = Itly.

Consonants
Th–stopping occurs, where the dental fricatives /θ, ð/ may be realized as stops (/t, d/ respectively); for instance, this may sound more like diss.
L–vocalization is common at the end of a word. The sound /l/ is often replaced by the semivowel or glide w and/or o or ʊ. Pronunciation of words like middle and college become ˈmɪdo and ˈkɑwɪdʒ respectively.
Epenthetic /r/ often occurs; notably, wash is pronounced as wɑɻʃ, popularly written as warsh, and Washington is pronounced as Warshington.
As is common in many US dialects, /t/ is frequently elided after /n/, thus hunter is pronounced ˈhʌnɚ.

African-American variations
According to linguists, the "hon" dialect that is popularized in the media and that derives historically from the speech of by white blue-collar residents of South and Southeast [Baltimore](3179) is not the only accent spoken in the region. There is also a particular [Baltimore](3179) accent found among Black [Baltimore](3179)ans: a sub-type of [African-American Vernacular English](4417).
For example, among Black speakers, [Baltimore](3179) is pronounced more like "Baldamore" /ˌbɔldəˈmɔr/, as compared to "Bawlmer" /ˈbɔlmər/. Other notable phonological characteristics include vowel centralization before /r/ (such that words such as "carry" and "parents" are often pronounced as "curry" or "purrents", and "Aaron earned an iron urn" might sound like "Urrun urned an urn urn") and the mid-centralization of /ɑ/, particularly in the word "dog," often pronounced like "dug," and "frog" as "frug."
The African-American [Baltimore](3179) accent, or a variation thereof, is also shared by many African Americans throughout Maryland and the Washington metropolitan area.
