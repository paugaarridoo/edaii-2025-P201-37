Andreas Acrivos (born 13 June 1928) is the Albert Einstein Professor of Science and Engineering, emeritus at the City College of New York. He is also the director of the Benjamin Levich Institute for Physicochemical Hydrodynamics.

Education and career
Born in [Athens](599), Greece, Acrivos moved to the United States to pursue an engineering education. He received a bachelor's degree from Syracuse University in 1950, a master's degree from the University of Minnesota in 1951, and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1954; all in chemical engineering.
Acrivos is considered to be one of the leading fluid dynamicists of the 20th century. In 1954 Acrivos joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1962, he moved to Stanford University, where he worked with Professor David Mason to build chemical engineering programs. In 1977, he was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions in the application of mathematical analysis to the understanding of fundamental phenomena in chemical engineering processes. In 1987 Acrivos joined as the Albert Einstein Professor of Science and Engineering at The City College of the City University of New York, succeeding Veniamin Levich.
From 1982 to 1997 Acrivos served as the editor-in-chief of Physics of Fluids.
