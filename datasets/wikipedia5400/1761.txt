African Union Commission
The  [Africa](1700)n Union Commission (AUC) acts as the executive/administrative branch or secretariat of the [Africa](1700)n Union (and is somewhat analogous to the European Commission).  It consists of a number of Commissioners dealing with different areas of policy.  The [Africa](1700)n Union Headquarters are in [Addis Ababa](1742), Ethiopia. It should be distinguished from the [Africa](1700)n Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, (based in Banjul, Gambia), which is a separate body that reports to the [Africa](1700)n Union.

History
On September 13, 2005 an agreement was reached by the Commission and France whereby France would donate €5 million for the furtherance of [Africa](1700)n Union activities. Some of the initiatives this money will go to are an [Africa](1700)n Communication Policy and an [Africa](1700)n Common Defence Force. The signatory on behalf of the Commission was Bernard Zoba.
The [Africa](1700)n Union Commission became a part of the Forum on China–[Africa](1700) Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2012. FOCAC is the main multi-lateral coordination mechanism between the [Africa](1700)n countries and China. Since joining FOCAC, the [Africa](1700)n Union Commission has increasingly played a coordinating role, although each [Africa](1700)n country in FOCAC continues to represent itself individually.
