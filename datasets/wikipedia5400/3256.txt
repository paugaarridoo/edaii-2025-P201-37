Blue Sky Mausoleum
Blue Sky Mausoleum, in Forest Lawn Cemetery in [Buffalo, New York](3263), is the 2004 completion of a 1928 design by [Frank Lloyd Wright](3201) as a commercial cemetery project.  The design was completed by a one-time apprentice to Wright, Anthony Puttnam.
Puttnam was also responsible for the posthumous completion of Wright's Monona Terrace building in Madison, Wisconsin in modified form, and he has defended both projects against accusations that they are inauthentic.
The Mausoleum was the last of four projects Darwin D. Martin commissioned from Wright; the others were his residential complex, the Larkin Administration Building, and Graycliff, their summer house.
