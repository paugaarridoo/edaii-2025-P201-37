Baltic Basketball League
Baltic [Basketball](2400) League (BBL) was the [Baltic states](1669) basketball league founded in 2004. The league mainly focused on teams from the [Baltic states](1669), but teams from [Sweden](1600), Russia, Kazakhstan, [Finland](2238), and [Belarus](1683) have participated in the Baltic League. After the 2017–18 season, the league announced that it was suspending its operations.

History
For the 2015–16 season, the format of the BBL included a regular season composed by two groups of seven teams that competed in a round-robin competition system, with each team facing their opponent twice. The teams qualified for the eight-finals based on their ranking after the regular season. Out of the five teams who participated in FIBA [Europe](1994) Cup competition – Ventspils, Juventus, Šiauliai, Tartu Ülikool/Rock and Pieno žvaigždės – the latter three did not qualify for the FIBA [Europe](1994) Cup playoffs and thus started playing at the start of the BBL playoffs, seeded respectively first, second and third based on last season's results. All play-off games are played in home-and-away series.
Baltic [Basketball](2400) League also featured a Baltic [Basketball](2400) League Cup competition before the beginning of the regular season since 2008.
