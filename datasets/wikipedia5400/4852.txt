Aliran Kepercayaan
Aliran Kepercayaan (English: the branches/flows of beliefs) is an official cover term for groups of followers of various religious movements. It also includes various, partly syncretic forms of mysticism of new religious movements in Indonesia, such as kebatinan, kejiwaan, and kerohanian. In the Indonesian language, it is also used for new religious movements in other parts of the world. Based on data collected by the Indonesian Conference on Religion and Peace (ICRP), there are about 245 unofficial indigenous religions in Indonesia.

Characteristics
According to Caldarola, kepercayaan "is not an apt characterization of what the mystical groups have in common". The US State Department's states:

Sizeable populations in Java, Kalimantan, and Papua practice animism and other types of traditional belief systems termed "Aliran Kepercayaan." Many of those who practice Kepercayaan describe it as more of a meditation-based spiritual path than a religion. Some animists combine their beliefs with one of the government-recognized religions.

Recognition
The Indonesian Government recognizes the right to follow Aliran Kepercayaan, as long as its practitioners do not upset the public order or offend the sensitivities of the followers of the major religions.
Indonesia's Constitutional Court in November 2017 ruled that followers of faiths outside the 6 recognized religions are allowed to state "Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan YME in their national identity cards, as a 7th category for Aliran Kepercayaan after judicial review launched by followers of Marapu religion, the Parmalim, Kaharingan, and Sapta Darma.
