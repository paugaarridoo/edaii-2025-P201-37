Overview
The city of Arboga is known to have existed as a town since the 13th century but the area has been inhabited since around 900 AD.

The city was at one time a residence of the royal family of Vasa. It was the scene of church assemblies and national diets, and it is known for the antiquities in its neighborhood.
