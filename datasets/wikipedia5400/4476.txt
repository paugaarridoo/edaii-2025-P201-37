Phonology
Consonants
Word-initially /t/ and /d/ are dental. Word-final /t/ can be sometimes fully released and sometimes fully deleted, such as in but bʌ and about əbaʷ. Word-medially /t/ can occur as either a stop or glottal stop, hence after is either aftə or afʔə.
Word-initially H is variably present. The fricatives are pronounced as dentals: 'think' tɪŋk, 'there' dɛ. Nasal backing is common after back vowels: "Hamilton" sounds like hamɪltɔŋ. /l/ is normally light in all positions, the /r/ is a retroflex ɹ and rhoticity is variable. 
/str/ is pronounced as /ʃtr/: industry is ɪndʌʃtri. Final clusters may be devoiced (kids: kɪts) and final stops in clusters can be deleted (respect: rispɛk). There is restricted metathesis: words like ask, crisp and crispy are pronounced as æks, krɪps, and krɪpsi; but mask is pronounced as ma:s.
/k/ and /g/ tend to be palatalized: Coast Guard kʲo:s gʲa:d.
