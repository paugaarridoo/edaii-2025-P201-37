Aragonese language
[Aragon](2509)ese ( ARR-ə-gə-NEEZ; aragonés aɾaɣoˈnes in [Aragon](2509)ese) is a Romance language spoken in several dialects by about 12,000 people as of 2011, in the Pyrenees valleys of [Aragon](2509), Spain, primarily in the comarcas of Somontano de Barbastro, Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza/Ribagorça. It is the only modern language which survived from medieval Navarro-[Aragon](2509)ese in a form distinct from Spanish.
Historically, people referred to the language as fabla ('talk' or 'speech'). Native [Aragon](2509)ese people usually refer to it by the names of its local dialects such as cheso (from Valle de Hecho) or patués (from the Benasque Valley).

History
[Aragon](2509)ese, which developed in portions of the Ebro basin, can be traced back to the High Middle Ages. It spread throughout the Pyrenees to areas where languages similar to modern Basque might have been previously spoken. The Kingdom of [Aragon](2509) (formed by the counties of [Aragon](2509), Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the Moors farther south in the Reconquista and spreading the [Aragon](2509)ese language.
The union of the Catalan counties and the Kingdom of [Aragon](2509) which formed the 12th-century Crown of [Aragon](2509) did not merge the languages of the two territories; Catalan continued to be spoken in the east and Navarro-[Aragon](2509)ese in the west, with the boundaries blurred by dialectal continuity. The [Aragon](2509)ese Reconquista in the south ended with the cession of Murcia by James I of [Aragon](2509) to the Kingdom of Castile as dowry for an [Aragon](2509)ese princess.
The best-known proponent of the [Aragon](2509)ese language was Johan Ferrandez d'Heredia, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in [Aragon](2509)ese and translated several works from Greek into [Aragon](2509)ese (the first in medieval Europe).
The spread of Castilian (Spanish), the Castilian origin of the Trastámara dynasty, and the similarity between Castilian (Spanish) and [Aragon](2509)ese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian Ferdinand I of [Aragon](2509), also known as Ferdinand of Antequera.
In the early 18th century, after the defeat of the allies of [Aragon](2509) in the War of the Spanish Succession, Philip V ordered the prohibition of the [Aragon](2509)ese language in schools and the establishment of Castilian (Spanish) as the only official language in [Aragon](2509). This was ordered in the [Aragon](2509)ese Nueva Planta decrees of 1707.
In recent times, [Aragon](2509)ese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 [Spanish transition to democracy](3940) heralded literary works and studies of the language.

Modern [Aragon](2509)ese
[Aragon](2509)ese is the native language of the [Aragon](2509)ese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the comarcas of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which [Aragon](2509)ese is spoken are Huesca, Graus, Monzón, Barbastro, Bielsa, Chistén, Fonz, Echo, Estadilla, Benasque, Campo, Sabiñánigo, Jaca, Plan, Ansó, Ayerbe, Broto, and El Grado.
It is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of Zaragoza, Huesca, Ejea de los Caballeros, or Teruel. According to recent polls, there are about 25,500 speakers (2011) including speakers living outside the native area. In 2017, the Dirección General de Política Lingüística de Aragón estimated there were 10,000 to 12,000 active speakers of [Aragon](2509)ese.
In 2009, the Languages Act of [Aragon](2509) (Law 10/2009) recognized the "native language, original and historic" of [Aragon](2509). The language received several linguistic rights, including its use in public administration. Some of the legislation was repealed by a new law in 2013 (Law 3/2013).

Phonology
Traits
[Aragon](2509)ese has many historical traits in common with Catalan. Some are conservative features that are also shared with the [Asturleonese language](4246)s and Galician–Portuguese, where Spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages.

Shared with Catalan
Romance initial f- is preserved, e.g. filium > fillo ('son', Sp. hijo, Cat. fill, Pt. filho).
Romance groups cl-, fl- and pl- are preserved and in most dialects do not undergo any change, e.g. clavis > clau ('key', Sp. llave, Cat. clau, Pt. chave). However, in some transitional dialects from both sides (Ribagorzano in [Aragon](2509)ese and Ribagorçà and Pallarès in Catalan) it becomes cll-, fll- and pll-, e.g. clavis > cllau.
Romance palatal approximant (ge-, gi-, i-) consistently became medieval dʒ, as in medieval Catalan and Portuguese. This becomes modern ch tʃ, as a result of the devoicing of sibilants (see below). In Spanish, the medieval result was either dʒ/ʒ, (modern x), ʝ, or nothing, depending on the context. e.g. iuvenem > choven ('young man', Sp. joven /ˈxoβen/, Cat. jove /ˈʒoβə/), gelare > chelar ('to freeze', Sp. helar /eˈlaɾ/, Cat. gelar /ʒəˈla/).
Romance groups -lt-, -ct- result in jt, e.g. factum > feito ('done', Sp. hecho, Cat. fet, Gal./Port. feito), multum > muito ('many, much', Sp. mucho, Cat. molt, Gal. moito, Port. muito).
Romance groups -x-, -ps-, scj- result in voiceless palatal fricative ix ʃ, e.g. coxu > coixo ('crippled', Sp. cojo, Cat. coix).
Romance groups -lj-, -c'l-, -t'l- result in palatal lateral ll ʎ, e.g. muliere > muller ('woman', Sp. mujer, Cat. muller), acuc'la > agulla ('needle', Sp. aguja, Cat. agulla).

Shared with Catalan and Spanish
Open o, e from Romance result systematically in diphthongs we, je, e.g. vet'la > viella ('old woman', Sp. vieja, Cat. vella, Pt. velha). This includes before a palatal approximant, e.g. octō > ueito ('eight', Sp. ocho, Cat. vuit, Pt. oito). Spanish diphthongizes except before yod, whereas Catalan only diphthongizes before yod.
Voiced stops /b, d, ɡ/ may be lenited to approximants β, ð, ɣ.

Shared with Spanish
Loss of final unstressed -e but not -o, e.g. grande > gran ('big'), factum > feito ('done').  Catalan loses both -e and -o (Cat. gran, fet); Spanish preserves -o and sometimes -e (Sp. hecho, gran ~ grande).
Former voiced sibilants become voiceless (z > s, dʒ > tʃ).
The palatal /j/ is most often realized as a fricative ʝ.

Shared with neither
Latin -b- is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the second and third conjugations: teneba, teniba ('he had', Sp. tenía, Cat. tenia), dormiba ('he was sleeping', Sp. dormía, Cat. dormia).
High [Aragon](2509)ese dialects (alto aragonés) and some dialects of Gascon have preserved the voicelessness of many intervocalic stop consonants, e.g. cletam > cleta ('sheep hurdle', Cat. cleda, Fr. claie), cuculliatam > cocullata ('crested lark', Sp. cogujada, Cat. cogullada).
Several [Aragon](2509)ese dialects maintain Latin -ll- as geminate /ll/.
The mid vowels /e, o/ can be as open as ɛ, ɔ, mainly in the Benasque dialect.
No native word can begin with an /r/, a trait shared with Gascon and Basque.

Orthography
Before 2023, [Aragon](2509)ese had three orthographic standards:

The grafía de Uesca, codified in 1987 by the Consello d'a Fabla [Aragon](2509)esa (CFA) at a convention in Huesca, is used by most [Aragon](2509)ese writers. It has a more uniform system of assigning letters to phonemes, with less regard for etymology; words traditionally written with ⟨v⟩ and ⟨b⟩ are uniformly written with ⟨b⟩ in the Uesca system. Similarly, ⟨ch⟩, ⟨j⟩, and ⟨g⟩ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ are all written ⟨ch⟩. It uses letters associated with Spanish, such as ⟨ñ⟩.
The grafia SLA, devised in 2004 by the Sociedat de Lingüistica [Aragon](2509)esa (SLA), is used by some [Aragon](2509)ese writers. It uses etymological forms which are closer to Catalan, Occitan, and medieval [Aragon](2509)ese sources; trying to come closer to the original [Aragon](2509)ese and the other Occitano-Romance languages. In the SLA system ⟨v⟩, ⟨b⟩,⟨ch⟩, ⟨j⟩, and ⟨g⟩ before ⟨e⟩ and ⟨i⟩ are distinct, and the digraph ⟨ny⟩ replaces ⟨ñ⟩.
In 2010, the Academia de l'[Aragon](2509)és (founded in 2006) established an orthographic standard to modernize medieval orthography and to make it more etymological.
During the 16th century, [Aragon](2509)ese Moriscos wrote aljamiado texts (Romance texts in [Arabic](4233) script), possibly because of their inability to write in [Arabic](4233). The language in these texts has a mixture of [Aragon](2509)ese and Castilian traits, and they are among the last known written examples of the [Aragon](2509)ese formerly spoken in central and southern [Aragon](2509).

In 2023, a new orthographic standard has been published by the Academia [Aragon](2509)esa de la Lengua. This version is close to the Academia de l'[Aragon](2509)és orthography, but with the following differences: /kw/ is always spelled ⟨cu⟩, e. g. cuan, cuestión (exception is made for some loanwords: quad, quadrívium, quark, quásar, quáter, quórum); /ɲ/ is spelled ⟨ny⟩ or ⟨ñ⟩ by personal preference; final ⟨z⟩ is not written as ⟨tz⟩.
The marginal phoneme /x/ (only in loanwords, e. g. jabugo) is spelled j in the Uesca, Academia de l'[Aragon](2509)és and Academia [Aragon](2509)esa de la Lengua standards (not mentioned in the SLA standard). Additionally, the Academia de l'[Aragon](2509)és and Academia [Aragon](2509)esa de la Lengua orthographies allow the letter j in some loanwords internationally known with it (e. g. jazz, jacuzzi, which normally have /tʃ/ in the [Aragon](2509)ese pronunciation) and also mention the letters k and w, also used only in loanwords (w may represent /b/ or /w/).

Grammar
[Aragon](2509)ese grammar has a lot in common with Occitan and Catalan, but also Spanish.

Articles
The definite article in [Aragon](2509)ese has undergone dialect-related changes,  with definite articles in Old [Aragon](2509)ese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. There are two main forms:

These forms are used in the eastern and some central dialects.

These forms are used in the western and some central dialects.

Lexicology
Neighboring Romance languages have influenced [Aragon](2509)ese. Catalan and Occitan influenced [Aragon](2509)ese for many years. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced [Aragon](2509)ese; it was adopted throughout [Aragon](2509) as the first language, limiting [Aragon](2509)ese to the northern region surrounding the Pyrenees. French has also influenced [Aragon](2509)ese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and English has introduced a number of new words into the language.

Gender
Words that were part of the Latin second declension—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:

filiu(m) > fillo ('son')
sciuru + olu(m) > esquiruelo, esquirol ('squirrel')
Words that were part of the Latin first declension are usually feminine:

filia(m) > filla ('daughter').
Some Latin neuter plural nouns joined the first declension as singular feminine nouns: 

folia > fuella ('leaf').
Words ending in -or are feminine:

a honor, a calor, a color, and (in Medieval [Aragon](2509)ese) la amor
The names of fruit trees usually end in -era (a suffix derived from Latin -aria) and are usually feminine:

a perera, a manzanera, a nuquera, a castanyera, a tellera / o tilero, a olivera, a ciresera, l'almendrera
The genders of river names vary:

Many ending in -a are feminine: a Cinca/a Cinga, a Cinqueta, a Garona, L'Arba, a Noguera, a Isuela, La Uecha, La Uerva, etc. The last was known as río de la Uerba during the 16th century.
Many from the second and the third declension are masculine: L'Ebro, O Galligo, O Flumen, L'Alcanadre.

Pronouns
Just like most other Occitano-Romance languages, [Aragon](2509)ese has partitive and locative clitic pronouns derived from the Latin inde and ibi: en/ne and bi/i/ie; unlike Ibero-Romance.
Such pronouns are present in most major Romance languages (Catalan en and hi, Occitan ne and i, French en and y, and Italian ne and ci/vi).
En/ne is used for:

Partitive objects: No n'he visto como aquello ("I haven't seen anything like that", literally 'Not (of it) I have seen like that').
Partitive subjects: En fa tanto de mal ("It hurts so much", literally '(of it) it causes so much of pain')
Ablatives, places from which movements originate: Se'n va ra memoria ("Memory goes away", literally '(away from the mind) memory goes')
Bi/hi/ie is used for:

Locatives, where something takes place: N'hi heba uno ("There was one of them"), literally '(Of them) there was one')
Allatives, places that movements go towards or end: Vés-be ('Go there (imperative)')

Literature
[Aragon](2509)ese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history Liber Regum, Razón feita d'amor, Libre dels tres reys d'orient, and Vida de Santa María Egipcíaca date from this period; an [Aragon](2509)ese version of the Chronicle of the Morea also exists, differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea.

Early modern period
Since 1500, Spanish has been the cultural language of [Aragon](2509); many [Aragon](2509)ese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.
[Aragon](2509)ese became a popular village language. During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear. In a 1650 Huesca literary contest, [Aragon](2509)ese poems were submitted by Matías Pradas, Isabel de Rodas and "Fileno, montañés".

Contemporary literature
The 19th and 20th centuries have seen a renaissance of [Aragon](2509)ese literature in several dialects. In 1844, Braulio Foz's novel Vida de Pedro Saputo was published in the Almudévar (southern) dialect. The 20th century featured Domingo Miral's costumbrist comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa's poetry, both in Hecho (western) [Aragon](2509)ese; Cleto Torrodellas' poetry and Tonón de Baldomera's popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero's costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela's novel A Lueca, historia d'una moceta d'o Semontano, also in the southern dialect.

[Aragon](2509)ese in modern education
The 1997 [Aragon](2509)ese law of languages stipulated that [Aragon](2509)ese (and Catalan) speakers had a right to the teaching of and in their own language. Following this, [Aragon](2509)ese lessons started in schools in the 1997–1998 academic year. It was originally taught as an extra-curricular, non-evaluable voluntary subject in four schools. However, whilst legally schools can choose to use [Aragon](2509)ese as the language of instruction, as of the 2013–2014 academic year, there are no recorded instances of this option being taken in primary or secondary education. In fact, the only current scenario in which [Aragon](2509)ese is used as the language of instruction is in the [Aragon](2509)ese philology university course, which is optional, taught over the summer and in which only some of the lectures are in [Aragon](2509)ese.

Pre-school education
In pre-school education, students whose parents wish them to be taught [Aragon](2509)ese receive between thirty minutes to one hour of [Aragon](2509)ese lessons a week. In the 2014–2015 academic year there were 262 students recorded in pre-school [Aragon](2509)ese lessons.

Primary school education
The subject of [Aragon](2509)ese now has a fully developed curriculum in primary education in [Aragon](2509). Despite this, in the 2014–2015 academic year there were only seven [Aragon](2509)ese teachers in the region across both pre-primary and primary education and none hold permanent positions, whilst the number of primary education students receiving [Aragon](2509)ese lessons was 320.
As of 2017 there were 1068 reported [Aragon](2509)ese language students and 12 [Aragon](2509)ese language instructors in [Aragon](2509).

Secondary school education
There is no officially approved program or teaching materials for the [Aragon](2509)ese language at the secondary level, and though two non-official textbooks are available (Pos ixo... Materials ta aprender aragonés (Benítez, 2007) and [Aragon](2509)és ta Secundaria (Campos, 2014)) many instructors create their own learning materials. Further, most schools with [Aragon](2509)ese programs that have the possibility of being offered as an examinative subject have elected not to do so.
As of 2007 it is possible to use [Aragon](2509)ese as a language of instruction for multiple courses; however, no program is yet to instruct any curricular or examinative courses in [Aragon](2509)ese.
As of the 2014–2015 academic year there were 14 [Aragon](2509)ese language students at the secondary level.

Higher education
[Aragon](2509)ese is not currently a possible field of study for a bachelor's or postgraduate degree in any official capacity, nor is [Aragon](2509)ese used as a medium of instruction.  A bachelor's or master's degree may be obtained in Magisterio (teaching) at the University of Zaragoza; however, no specialization in [Aragon](2509)ese language is currently available. As such those who wish to teach [Aragon](2509)ese at the pre-school, primary, or secondary level must already be competent in the language by being a native speaker or by other means. Further, prospective instructors must pass an ad hoc exam curated by the individual schools at which they wish to teach in order to prove their competence, as there are no recognized standard competency exams for the [Aragon](2509)ese language.
Since the 1994–1995 academic year, [Aragon](2509)ese has been an elective subject within the bachelor's degree for primary school education at the University of Zaragoza's Huesca campus.
The University of Zaragoza's Huesca campus also offers a Diploma de Especialización (These are studies that require a previous university degree and have a duration of between 30 and 59 ECTS credits.) in [Aragon](2509)ese Philology with 37 ECTS credits.
