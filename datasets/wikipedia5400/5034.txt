Impermanence (Buddhism)
Impermanence, called anicca (Pāli) or anitya (Sanskrit), appears extensively in the Pali Canon as one of the essential doctrines of [Buddhism](5001). The doctrine asserts that all of conditioned existence, without exception, is "transient, evanescent, inconstant". 
[Anicca](5034) is one of the three marks of existence—the other two are dukkha (suffering or unsatisfactory) and anatta (without a lasting essence).
[Anicca](5034) is in contrast to nirvana, the reality that is nicca, or knows no change, decay or death.

In the marks of existence
[Anicca](5034) is understood in [Buddhism](5001) as the first of the three marks of existence (trilakshana), the other two being dukkha ('unease', from dushta, "standing unstable") and anatta (non-self, non-soul, no essence). It appears in Pali texts as, "sabbe sankhara anicca, sabbe sankhara dukkha, sabbe dhamma anatta", which Szczurek translates as, "all conditioned things are impermanent, all conditioned things are painful, all dhammas are without Self".
All physical and mental events, states [Buddhism](5001), come into being and dissolve. Human life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of repeated birth and death (Samsara), nothing lasts, and everything decays. This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including beings who have reincarnated in deva (god) and naraka (hell) realms.
Everything, whether physical or mental, is a formation (Saṅkhāra), has a dependent origination and is impermanent. It arises, changes and disappears. According to [Buddhism](5001), everything in human life, all objects, as well as all beings whether in heavenly or hellish or earthly realms in Buddhist cosmology, is always changing, inconstant, undergoes rebirth and redeath (Samsara).

Association with anatta
[Anicca](5034) is intimately associated with the doctrine of anatta, according to which things have no essence, permanent self, or unchanging soul. Understanding [Anicca](5034) and [Anatta](5029) are steps in the Buddhist's spiritual progress toward enlightenment.

Association with dukkha
Impermanence is a source of dukkha. The Buddha taught that because no physical or mental object is permanent, desires for or attachments to either causes suffering (dukkha).
