Catalan language
[C](855)atalan (català) is a Western Romance language. It is the official language of [Andorra](1549), and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: [C](855)atalonia, the [Balearic Islands](2515) and the Valencian [C](855)ommunity, where it is called Valencian (valencià). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero, and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of [Aragon](2509) and the [C](855)arche area in the Region of Murcia. The [C](855)atalan-speaking territories are often called the Països [C](855)atalans or "[C](855)atalan [C](855)ountries".
The language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a [C](855)atalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.

Etymology and pronunciation
The word [C](855)atalan is derived from the territorial name of [C](855)atalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that [C](855)atalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the [C](855)atalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > [C](855)atalonia theoretically derived.
In English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as [C](855)atelaner, followed in the 15th century as [C](855)atellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word [C](855)atalan can be pronounced in English as  KAT-ə-lən, -⁠lan or  KAT-ə-LAN.
The endonym is pronounced kətəˈla in the Eastern [C](855)atalan dialects, and kataˈla in the Western dialects. In the Valencian [C](855)ommunity and [C](855)arche, the term valencià valensiˈa is frequently used instead. Thus, the name "Valencian", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian [C](855)ommunity and [C](855)arche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole, synonymous with "[C](855)atalan". Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL) and the Institut d'Estudis [C](855)atalans (IE[C](855)). (See also status of Valencian below).

History
Middle Ages
By the 9th century, [C](855)atalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the [C](855)atalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the [C](855)ounty of [Barcelona](1000) from the [C](855)arolingian Empire in 988.
In the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show [C](855)atalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old [C](855)atalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.
During the 11th and 12th centuries the [C](855)atalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with [C](855)atalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.
In the Low Middle Ages, [C](855)atalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great [C](855)hronicles (13th–14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the [C](855)rown of [Aragon](2509), and [C](855)atalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal [C](855)hancery propagated a highly standardized language. [C](855)atalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what [C](855)osta [C](855)arreras terms "one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe".
Martorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the [Iberian Peninsula](2686) was printed in [C](855)atalan.

Start of the modern era
Spain
With the union of the crowns of [C](855)astille and [Aragon](2509) in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the [C](855)rown of [Aragon](2509) by the [C](855)rown of [C](855)astile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups. Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.
The process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the [C](855)atalan territory: they "will take the utmost care to introduce the [C](855)astilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed". From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal [C](855)ertificate forbidding anyone to "represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish". The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of [C](855)atalan. Starting in the 16th century, [C](855)atalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.

France
With the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of [C](855)atalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local [C](855)atalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.
Shortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as [C](855)atalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.

France: 19th to 20th century
After the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many [C](855)atalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French [C](855)atalonia and Menorca migrated to [Algiers](1845).
By 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,  as their speech was called. After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir [C](855)atalan speakers fled to Northern [C](855)atalonia or Alicante.
The French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General [C](855)ouncil of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized [C](855)atalan as one of the départment's languages and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.

Spain: 18th to 20th century
In 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only [C](855)atalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate [C](855)atalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in [Barcelona](1000) was also asked. He declared that [C](855)atalan "is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses", indicating that it was spoken everywhere "with the exception of the royal courts". He also indicated that [C](855)atalan was spoken "in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, [C](855)orsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d "Aran and [C](855)erdaña".
The defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the [C](855)atalan language declined into the 18th century.
However, the 19th century saw a [C](855)atalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama). In the 19th century, the region of [C](855)arche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. [C](855)atalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against [C](855)atalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of [C](855)atalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of [C](855)atalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of [Barcelona](1000).
The [C](855)atalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish [C](855)ivil War (1936–1939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), which abolished the official status of [C](855)atalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of [C](855)atalan in them. Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in [C](855)atalan almost disappeared. Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some [C](855)atalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of [C](855)atalan. Despite all of these hardships, [C](855)atalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of [C](855)atalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent [C](855)atalan authors resisted the suppression through literature. Private initiative contests were created to reward works in [C](855)atalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), Víctor [C](855)atalà prize (1953) [C](855)arles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of [C](855)atalan Letters (1969). The first [C](855)atalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964. At the same time, oppression of the [C](855)atalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.
In addition to the loss of prestige for [C](855)atalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into [C](855)atalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of [C](855)atalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. [C](855)atalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual. Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in [C](855)atalan since the end of the [C](855)ivil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.

Present day
Since the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), [C](855)atalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In [C](855)atalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of [C](855)atalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of [C](855)atalonia in two situations—if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students. There is also some intergenerational shift towards [C](855)atalan.
More recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the [C](855)atalan educational system. As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme [C](855)ourt urged the [C](855)atalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.
According to the Statistical Institute of [C](855)atalonia, in 2013 the [C](855)atalan language is the second most commonly used in [C](855)atalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both [C](855)atalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with [C](855)atalan and 47.5% only Spanish. In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with [C](855)atalan and 47.5% with Spanish. To promote use of [C](855)atalan, the Generalitat de [C](855)atalunya ([C](855)atalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of [C](855)atalan in [C](855)atalonia and in other territories, with entities such as [C](855)onsorci per a la Normalització Lingüística ([C](855)onsortium for Linguistic Normalization).
In [Andorra](1549), [C](855)atalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring [C](855)atalan have been enforced, such as [C](855)atalan medium education.
On the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern [C](855)atalonia area of France, [C](855)atalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). [C](855)atalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in [C](855)atalan language immersion programs.
In Alicante province, [C](855)atalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian [C](855)ommunity, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.
During the 20th century many [C](855)atalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, [C](855)uba, [Argentina](1862), and other South American countries. They formed a large number of [C](855)atalan colonies that today continue to maintain the [C](855)atalan language. They also founded many [C](855)atalan casals (associations).

[C](855)lassification and relationship with other Romance languages
One classification of [C](855)atalan is given by Pèire Bèc:

Romance languages
Italo-Western languages
Western Romance languages
Gallo-Iberian languages
Gallo-Romance languages
Occitano-Romance languages
[C](855)atalan language
However, the ascription of [C](855)atalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal.
[C](855)atalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and [C](855)atalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, [C](855)atalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.

Relationship with other Romance languages
Some include [C](855)atalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. [C](855)atalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century and still today remains its closest relative.
[C](855)atalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the [Iberian Peninsula](2686), [C](855)atalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Provençal, French, Gallo-Italian).
According to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between [C](855)atalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.

During much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the [C](855)atalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and [C](855)atalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).
There is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. [C](855)atalan bullir, Occitan bolir "to boil") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. [C](855)atalan torell, Occitan taurèl "bullock"), while [C](855)atalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.

Like all Romance languages, [C](855)atalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:

verbs: cōnfīgere 'to fasten; transfix' > confegir 'to compose, write up', congemināre > conjuminar 'to combine, conjugate', de-ex-somnitare > deixondar/-ir 'to wake; awaken', dēnsāre 'to thicken; crowd together' > desar 'to save, keep', īgnōrāre > enyorar 'to miss, yearn, pine for', indāgāre 'to investigate, track' > Old [C](855)atalan enagar 'to incite, induce', odiāre > Old [C](855)atalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', pācificāre > apaivagar 'to appease, mollify', repudiāre > rebutjar 'to reject, refuse';
nouns: brīsa > brisa 'pomace', buda > boga 'reedmace', catarrhu > cadarn 'catarrh', congesta > congesta 'snowdrift', dēlīrium > deler 'ardor, passion', fretu > freu 'brake', lābem > (a)llau 'avalanche', ōra > vora 'edge, border', pistrīce 'sawfish' > pestriu > pestiu 'thresher shark, smooth hound; ray', prūna 'live coal' > espurna 'spark', tardātiōnem > tardaó > tardor 'autumn'.
The Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and [C](855)atalan. For example, [C](855)atalan fang "mud" and rostir "to roast", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas [C](855)atalan filosa "spinning wheel" and templa "temple", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.
The same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, [C](855)atalan alfàbia "large earthenware jar" and rajola "tile", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas [C](855)atalan oli "oil" and oliva "olive", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.
Situated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), [C](855)atalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar "to miss somebody", apaivagar "to calm somebody down", and rebutjar "reject".

Geographic distribution
[C](855)atalan-speaking territories
Traditionally [C](855)atalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Països [C](855)atalans ([C](855)atalan [C](855)ountries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.

Number of speakers
The number of people known to be fluent in [C](855)atalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9–9.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where [C](855)atalan is spoken. The web site of the Generalitat de [C](855)atalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of [C](855)atalan. These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the [C](855)atalan population. According to Ethnologue, [C](855)atalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.

According to a 2011 study the total number of [C](855)atalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in [C](855)atalonia. More than half of them spoke [C](855)atalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in [C](855)atalonia). Very few [C](855)atalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the [C](855)atalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of [C](855)atalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of [C](855)atalan speakers in [C](855)atalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.
In Roussillon, only a minority of French [C](855)atalans speak [C](855)atalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the [C](855)atalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of [C](855)atalonia predominantly spoke [C](855)atalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both [C](855)atalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.
Spanish was the most spoken language in [Barcelona](1000) (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of [C](855)atalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, [C](855)atalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080). The share of [Barcelona](1000) residents who could speak it (72.3%) was lower than that of the overall [C](855)atalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of [C](855)atalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the [C](855)atalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in [Andorra](1549), and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.

Phonology
[C](855)atalan phonology varies by dialect. Notable features include:

Marked contrast of the vowel pairs /ɛ, e/ and /ɔ, o/, as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.
Lack of diphthongization of Latin short ĕ, ŏ, as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.
Abundance of diphthongs containing /w/, as in Galician and Portuguese.
In contrast to other Romance languages, [C](855)atalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, [C](855)atalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic ("male friend") vs. amiga ("female friend").
[C](855)entral [C](855)atalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety. For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.

Vowels
[C](855)atalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.
In [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > ə; /o, ɔ, u/ > u; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).

[C](855)onsonants
The consonant system of [C](855)atalan is rather conservative.

/l/ has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, /l/ is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern [C](855)atalan.
/v/ occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern [C](855)atalonia. It has merged with /b/ elsewhere.
Voiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing: /b/ > p, /d/ > t, /ɡ/ > k.
Voiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: /b/ > β, /d/ > ð, /ɡ/ > ɣ. Exceptions include /d/ after lateral consonants, and /b/ after /f/. In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.
There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/. Some sources describe them as "postalveolar". Others as "back alveolo-palatal", implying that the characters ⟨ɕ ʑ tɕ dʑ⟩ would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use ⟨ɕ ʑ⟩ for other languages such as Polish and [C](855)hinese.
The distribution of the two rhotics /r/ and /ɾ/ closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, r appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western [C](855)atalan generally featuring ɾ and [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled r unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case ɾ appears.
In careful speech, /n/, /m/, /l/ may be geminated. Geminated /ʎ/ may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic r as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics.

Phonological evolution
[C](855)atalan shares features with neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, Italian, Sardinian, French, Spanish).

Marked contrast of the vowel pairs /ɛ/ ~ /e/ and /ɔ/ ~ /o/, as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.
Lenition of voiced stops b → β, d → ð, ɡ → ɣ as in Galician and Spanish.
Lack of diphthongization of Latin short ĕ, ŏ, as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.
Abundance of diphthongs containing /w/, as in Galician and Portuguese.
Abundance of /ʎ/ and /ɲ/ occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll ("wet") and any ("year"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.
In contrast with other Romance languages, [C](855)atalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, [C](855)atalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').

Sociolinguistics
[C](855)atalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of [C](855)atalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of [C](855)atalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the [C](855)atalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).

Dialects
Overview
The dialects of the [C](855)atalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.
[C](855)atalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.
Western [C](855)atalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western [C](855)atalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms "[C](855)atalan" and "Valencian" (respectively used in [C](855)atalonia and the Valencian [C](855)ommunity) refer to two varieties of the same language. There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of [C](855)atalan Studies in [C](855)atalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian [C](855)ommunity.
[C](855)entral [C](855)atalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the [Barcelona](1000) province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.
[C](855)atalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, [C](855)atalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.

Pronunciation
Vowels
[C](855)atalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.
In Eastern [C](855)atalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > ə; /o, ɔ, u/ > u; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced e, o in some words. Algherese has lowered ə to a.
In Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern [C](855)atalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to o, with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western [C](855)atalan.
In Western [C](855)atalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ > e; /o, ɔ/ > o; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.
[C](855)entral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western [C](855)atalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in [C](855)entral and Western [C](855)atalan as well. As a result, [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan has a much higher incidence of /ɛ/.

[C](855)onsonants
[C](855)atalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals ((/l, ʎ/).
Most [C](855)atalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ → ɫ), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).
There is dialectal variation in regard to:

The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).
While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard [C](855)atalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like [C](855)entral Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.
The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme /v/.
The pronunciation or not of yod (/j/) in the digraph ⟨ix⟩.
The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either /ɾ/ or /r/).
The delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant (/ʎ/).
The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as /b/ in poble 'village, people' → β vs. b vs. bː vs. p vs. pː).

Morphology
Western [C](855)atalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian [C](855)ommunity, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian [C](855)ommunity and Western [C](855)atalonia.E.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western [C](855)atalan).
Eastern [C](855)atalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -∅ in all conjugations. E.g. parlo ([C](855)entral), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').

Western [C](855)atalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.
Eastern [C](855)atalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.
Western [C](855)atalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.
Eastern [C](855)atalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.E.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western [C](855)atalan in this case).

Vocabulary
Despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of [C](855)atalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan acts as an innovative element.

Standards
Standard [C](855)atalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern [C](855)atalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian [C](855)ommunity and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern [C](855)atalonia.
The most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ⟨e⟩ accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IE[C](855)) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent ⟨è⟩, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /ɛ/, in some words such as: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (AVL) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western [C](855)atalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').
In the [Balearic Islands](2515), IE[C](855)'s standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the [Balearic Islands](2515)'s philological section. In this way, for instance, IE[C](855) says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the [Balearic Islands](2515) must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').
In Alghero, the IE[C](855) has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, [C](855)atalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's "historical linguistic minorities" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.
In 2011, the [Aragon](2509)ese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of [C](855)atalan in La Franja (the so-called [C](855)atalan-speaking areas of [Aragon](2509)) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009. The new entity, designated as Institut [Aragon](2509)ès del [C](855)atalà, shall allow a facultative education in [C](855)atalan and a standardization of the [C](855)atalan language in La Franja.

Status of Valencian
Valencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western [C](855)atalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.
Linguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with [C](855)atalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian [C](855)ommunity, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and [C](855)atalan varieties.

The AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of [C](855)astelló (Normes de [C](855)astelló). [C](855)urrently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian [C](855)ulture (Real Acadèmia de [C](855)ultura Valenciana, RA[C](855)V), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.
Despite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from [C](855)atalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian [C](855)ulture (Real Acadèmia de [C](855)ultura Valenciana, RA[C](855)V), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from [C](855)atalan.
This clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European [C](855)onstitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, [C](855)atalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.

Vocabulary
Word choices
Despite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of [C](855)atalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually [C](855)entral [C](855)atalan acts as an innovative element.
Literary [C](855)atalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.

Latin and Greek loanwords
Like other languages, [C](855)atalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries [C](855)atalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Roís de [C](855)orella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or "bookish" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into [C](855)atalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the [C](855)hurch. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate [C](855)atalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in [C](855)atalan.

Word formation
The process of morphological derivation in [C](855)atalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where agglutination is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric əˈlɛktrik ("electrical") vs. electricitat ələktrisiˈtat. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure ("foresee").
There is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.

Writing system
[C](855)atalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The [C](855)atalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of [C](855)atalan was among the topics discussed during the First International [C](855)ongress of the [C](855)atalan Language, held in [Barcelona](1000) October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis [C](855)atalans (IE[C](855), founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogràfiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in [C](855)astelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de [C](855)astelló, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's [C](855)atalan language norms.

Grammar
The grammar of [C](855)atalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:

Use of definite and indefinite articles.
Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.
Verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).
There are no modal auxiliaries.
Word order is freer than in English.

Gender and number inflection
In gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa ("scarce"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:

Affrication: boig/boja ("insane") vs. lleig/lletja ("ugly")
Loss of n: pla/plana ("flat") vs. segon/segona ("second")
Final obstruent devoicing: sentit/sentida ("felt") vs. dit/dita ("said")
[C](855)atalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, [C](855)atalan has noi/noia ("boy"/"girl") and gall/gallina ("cock"/"hen"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.
There is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta ("boiling") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.
As in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos ("the pulse"/"the pulses") vs. la pols/les pols ("the dust"/"the dusts").

Determiners
The inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. [C](855)atalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels ("of + the plural"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).
[C](855)entral [C](855)atalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.

Personal pronouns
The morphology of [C](855)atalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).
[C](855)atalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.
This flexibility allows [C](855)atalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, [C](855)atalan can have m'hi recomanaren ("they recommended me to him"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).

Verbs
Like all the Romance languages, [C](855)atalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.
The [C](855)atalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar ("to go") + infinitive.
[C](855)atalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.

Syntax
The grammar of [C](855)atalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object. However, word order is very flexible. [C](855)ommonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence "The train has arrived" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean "the train has arrived", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as "what you might say while waiting in the station" versus "what you might say on the train".

[C](855)atalan names
In Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the [C](855)atalan conjunction i ("and").
