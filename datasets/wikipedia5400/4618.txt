Languages of Africa
The number of languages natively spoken in [Africa](1700) is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100, and by some counts at over 3,000. Nigeria alone has over 500 languages (according to SIL Ethnologue), one of the greatest concentrations of linguistic diversity in the world. The languages of [Africa](1700) belong to many distinct language families, among which the largest are:

Niger–Congo, which include the large Atlantic-Congo and Bantu branches in West, Central, Southeast and Southern [Africa](1700).
[Afroasiatic languages](1791) are spread throughout Western Asia, North [Africa](1700), the Horn of [Africa](1700) and parts of the Sahel.
Saharan, Nilotic and Central Sudanic languages (previously grouped under the hypothetical Nilo-Saharan macro-family), are present in East [Africa](1700) and Sahel.
[Austronesian languages](2925) are spoken in Madagascar and parts of the Comoros.
Khoe–Kwadi languages are spoken mostly in Namibia and [Botswana](4492).
Indo-European languages, while not indigenous to [Africa](1700), are spoken in South [Africa](1700) and Namibia ([Afrikaans](1787), English, German) and are used as lingua francas in Liberia and the former colonies of the United Kingdom (English), former colonies of France and of Belgium (French), former colonies of Portugal (Portuguese), former colonies of Italy (Italian), former colonies of Spain (Spanish) and the current Spanish territories of [Ceuta](4396), Melilla and the [Canary Islands](4372) and the current French territories of Mayotte and La Réunion.
There are several other small families and language isolates, as well as creoles and languages that have yet to be classified. In addition, [Africa](1700) has a wide variety of sign languages, many of which are language isolates.
Around a hundred languages are widely used for interethnic communication. These include [Arabic](4233), Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Somali, Hausa, Manding, Fulani and Yoruba, which are spoken as a second (or non-first) language by millions of people. Although many [Africa](1700)n languages are used on the radio, in newspapers and in primary-school education, and some of the larger ones are considered national languages, only a few are official at the national level. In Sub-Saharan [Africa](1700), most official languages at the national level tend to be colonial languages such as French, Portuguese, or English.
The [Africa](1700)n Union declared 2006 the "Year of [Africa](1700)n Languages".

Language groups
Most languages natively spoken in [Africa](1700) belong to one of the two large language families that dominate the continent: Afroasiatic, or Niger–Congo. Another hundred belong to smaller families such as Ubangian, Nilotic, Saharan, and the various families previously grouped under the umbrella term Khoisan. In addition, the languages of [Africa](1700) include several unclassified languages and sign languages.
The earliest [Afroasiatic languages](1791) are associated with the Capsian culture, the Saharan languages are linked with the Khartoum Mesolithic/Neolithic cultures. Niger-Congo languages are correlated with the west and central [Africa](1700)n hoe-based farming traditions and the Khoisan languages are matched with the south and southeastern Wilton culture.

[Afroasiatic languages](1791)
[Afroasiatic languages](1791) are spoken throughout North [Africa](1700), the Horn of [Africa](1700), Western Asia and parts of the Sahel. There are approximately 375 [Afroasiatic languages](1791) spoken by over 400 million people. The main subfamilies of Afroasiatic are Berber, [Chad](4691)ic, Cushitic, Omotic, [Egypt](1987)ian and Semitic. The Afroasiatic Urheimat is uncertain. The family's most extensive branch, the Semitic languages (including [Arabic](4233), Amharic and Hebrew among others), is the only branch of Afroasiatic that is spoken outside [Africa](1700).
Some of the most widely spoken [Afroasiatic languages](1791) include [Arabic](4233) (a Semitic language, and a recent arrival from West Asia), Somali (Cushitic), Berber (Berber), Hausa ([Chad](4691)ic), Amharic (Semitic) and Oromo (Cushitic). Of the world's surviving language families, Afroasiatic has the longest written history, as both the Akkadian language of Mesopotamia and Ancient [Egypt](1987)ian are members.

Nilo-Saharan languages
Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed grouping of some one hundred diverse languages. Genealogical linkage between these languages has failed to be conclusively demonstrated, and support for the proposal is sparse among linguists. The languages share some unusual morphology, but if they are related, most of the branches must have undergone major restructuring since diverging from their common ancestor. 
This hypothetical family would reach an expanse that stretches from the Nile Valley to northern Tanzania and into Nigeria and DR Congo, with the Songhay languages along the middle reaches of the Niger River as a geographic outlier. The inclusion of the Songhay languages is questionable, and doubts have been raised over the Koman, Gumuz and Kadu branches.
Some of the better known Nilo-Saharan languages are Kanuri, Fur, Songhay, Nobiin and the widespread Nilotic family, which includes the Luo, Dinka and Maasai. Most Nilo-Saharan languages are tonal, as are Niger-Congo languages.

Niger–Congo languages
The Niger–Congo languages constitute the largest language family spoken in West [Africa](1700) and perhaps the world in terms of the number of languages. One of its salient features is an elaborate noun class system with grammatical concord. A large majority of languages of this family are tonal such as Yoruba and Igbo, Akan and Ewe language. A major branch of Niger–Congo languages is the Bantu phylum, which has a wider speech area than the rest of the family (see Niger–Congo B (Bantu) in the map above).
The Niger–Kordofanian language family, joining Niger–Congo with the Kordofanian languages of south-central Sudan, was proposed in the 1950s by Joseph Greenberg. Today, linguists often use "Niger–Congo" to refer to this entire family, including Kordofanian as a subfamily. One reason for this is that it is not clear whether Kordofanian was the first branch to diverge from rest of Niger–Congo. Mande has been claimed to be equally or more divergent. Niger–Congo is generally accepted by linguists, though a few question the inclusion of Mande and Dogon, and there is no conclusive evidence for the inclusion of Ubangian.

Other language families
Several languages spoken in [Africa](1700) belong to language families concentrated or originating outside the [Africa](1700)n continent.

Austronesian
Malagasy belongs to the [Austronesian languages](2925) and is the westernmost branch of the family. It is the national and co-official language of Madagascar, and a Malagasy dialect called Bushi is also spoken in Mayotte.
The ancestors of the Malagasy people migrated to Madagascar around 1,500 years ago from Southeast Asia, more specifically the island of Borneo. The origins of how they arrived to Madagascar remains a mystery, however the Austronesians are known for their seafaring culture. Despite the geographical isolation, Malagasy still has strong resemblance to Barito languages especially the Ma'anyan language of southern Borneo. 
With more than 20 million speakers, Malagasy is one of the most widely spoken of the [Austronesian languages](2925).

Indo-European
[Afrikaans](1787) is Indo-European, as is most of the vocabulary of most [Africa](1700)n creole languages. [Afrikaans](1787) evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South [Africa](1700), where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century, including the loss of verbal conjugation (save for 5 modal verbs), as well as grammatical case and gender. Most [Afrikaans](1787) speakers live in South [Africa](1700). In Namibia it is the lingua franca. Overall 15 to 20 million people are estimated to speak [Afrikaans](1787).
Since the colonial era, Indo-European languages such as [Afrikaans](1787), English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish have held official status in many countries, and are widely spoken, generally as lingua francas. (See [Africa](1700)n French and [Africa](1700)n Portuguese.) Additionally, languages like French, and Portuguese have become native languages in various countries.
French has become native in the urban areas of the DRC, and Gabon.
German was once used in Germany's colonies there from the late 1800s until World War I, when Britain and France took over and revoked German's official status. Despite this, German is still spoken in Namibia, mostly among the white population. Although it lost its official status in the 1990s, it has been redesignated as a national language. Indian languages such as Gujarati are spoken by South Asian expatriates exclusively. In earlier historical times, other Indo-European languages could be found in various parts of the continent, such as Old Persian and Greek in [Egypt](1987), Latin and Vandalic in North [Africa](1700) and Modern Persian in the Horn of [Africa](1700).

Small families
The three small Khoisan families of southern [Africa](1700) have not been shown to be closely related to any other major language family. In addition, there are various other families that have not been demonstrated to belong to one of these families. The classifications below follow Glottolog.

Mande, some 70 languages, including the major languages of Mali and Guinea; these are generally thought to be divergent Niger–Congo, but debate persists
Ubangian, some 70 languages, centered on the languages of the Central [Africa](1700)n Republic; may be Niger–Congo
Te-Ne-Omotic, some 20 languages, previously classified under Afro-Asiatic, spoken in Ethiopia
Khoe-Kwadi, around 10 languages, the primary family of Khoisan languages of Namibia and [Botswana](4492)
Surmic, some 11 languages, previously classified within either Sudanic or Nilo-Saharan
Kx'a, around five languages, with various dialects, spoken in Southern [Africa](1700)
South Omotic, around five languages; previously classified within Afro-Asiatic, spoken in Ethiopia
Tuu, or Taa-ǃKwi, two surviving languages
Hadza, an isolate of Tanzania
Bangime, a likely isolate of Mali
Jalaa, a likely isolate of Nigeria
Sandawe, an isolate of Tanzania
Laal, a possible isolate of [Chad](4691)
Khoisan is a term of convenience covering some 30 languages spoken by around 300,000–400,000 people. There are five Khoisan families that have not been shown to be related to each other: Khoe, Tuu and Kx'a, which are found mainly in Namibia and [Botswana](4492), as well as Sandawe and Hadza of Tanzania, which are language isolates. A striking feature of Khoisan languages, and the reason they are often grouped together, is their use of click consonants. Some neighbouring [Bantu languages](4469) (notably Xhosa and Zulu) have clicks as well, but these were adopted from Khoisan languages. The Khoisan languages are also tonal.

Creole languages
Due partly to its multilingualism and its colonial past, a substantial proportion of the world's creole languages are to be found in [Africa](1700). Some are based on Indo-European languages (e.g. Krio from English in Sierra Leone and the very similar Pidgin in Nigeria, Ghana and parts of [Cameroon](4369); [Cape Verde](4679)an Creole in [Cape Verde](4679) and Guinea-Bissau Creole in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, all from Portuguese; Seychellois Creole in the Seychelles and Mauritian Creole in Mauritius, both from French); some are based on [Arabic](4233) (e.g. Juba [Arabic](4233) in the southern Sudan, or Nubi in parts of Uganda and Kenya); some are based on local languages (e.g. Sango, the main language of the Central [Africa](1700)n Republic); while in [Cameroon](4369) a creole based on French, English and local [Africa](1700)n languages known as [Camfranglais](4673) has started to become popular.

Unclassified languages
A fair number of unclassified languages are reported in [Africa](1700). Many remain unclassified simply for lack of data; among the better-investigated ones that continue to resist easy classification are:

possibly Afroasiatic: Ongota, Gomba
possibly Nilo-Saharan: Shabo
possibly Niger–Congo: Jalaa, Mbre, Bayot
unknown: Laal, Mpre
Of these, Jalaa is perhaps the most likely to be an isolate.
Less-well investigated languages include Irimba, Luo, Mawa, Rer Bare (possibly [Bantu languages](4469)), Bete (evidently Jukunoid), Bung (unclear), Kujarge (evidently [Chad](4691)ic), Lufu (Jukunoid), Meroitic (possibly Afroasiatic), Oropom (possibly spurious) and Weyto (evidently Cushitic). Several of these are extinct, and adequate comparative data is thus unlikely to be forthcoming. Hombert & Philippson (2009) list a number of [Africa](1700)n languages that have been classified as language isolates at one point or another. Many of these are simply unclassified, but Hombert & Philippson believe [Africa](1700) has about twenty language families, including isolates. Beside the possibilities listed above, there are:

Aasax or Aramanik (Tanzania) (South Cushitic? contains non-Cushitic lexicon)
Imeraguen (Mauritania) – Hassaniyya [Arabic](4233) restructured on an Azêr (Soninke) base
Kara (Fer?) (Central [Africa](1700)n Republic)
Oblo ([Cameroon](4369)) (Adamawa? Extinct?)
Roger Blench notes a couple additional possibilities:

Defaka (Nigeria)
Dompo (Ghana)
Below is a list of language isolates and otherwise unclassified languages in [Africa](1700), from Vossen & Dimmendaal (2020:434):

Sign languages
Many [Africa](1700)n countries have national sign languages, such as [Algeria](1317)n Sign Language, Tunisian Sign Language, Ethiopian Sign Language. Other sign languages are restricted to small areas or single villages, such as Adamorobe Sign Language in Ghana. Tanzania has seven, one for each of its schools for the Deaf, all of which are discouraged. Not much is known, since little has been published on these languages
Sign language systems extant in [Africa](1700) include the Paget Gorman Sign System used in Namibia and [Angola](1855), the Sudanese Sign languages used in Sudan and South Sudan, the Arab Sign languages used across the Arab Mideast, the Francosign languages used in Francophone [Africa](1700) and other areas such as Ghana and Tunisia, and the Tanzanian Sign languages used in Tanzania.

Language in [Africa](1700)
Throughout the long multilingual history of the [Africa](1700)n continent, [Africa](1700)n languages have been subject to phenomena like language contact, language expansion, language shift and language death. A case in point is the Bantu expansion, in which Bantu-speaking peoples expanded over most of Sub-Equatorial [Africa](1700), intermingling with Khoi-San speaking peoples from much of Southeast [Africa](1700) and Southern [Africa](1700) and other peoples from Central [Africa](1700). Another example is the Arab expansion in the 7th century, which led to the extension of [Arabic](4233) from its homeland in Asia, into much of North [Africa](1700) and the Horn of [Africa](1700).
Trade languages are another age-old phenomenon in the [Africa](1700)n linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations spread along trade routes and languages of peoples dominant in trade developed into languages of wider communication (lingua franca). Of particular importance in this respect are Berber (North and West [Africa](1700)), Jula (western West [Africa](1700)), Fulfulde (West [Africa](1700)), Hausa (West [Africa](1700)), Lingala (Congo), Swahili (Southeast [Africa](1700)), Somali (Horn of [Africa](1700)) and [Arabic](4233) (North [Africa](1700) and Horn of [Africa](1700)).
After gaining independence, many [Africa](1700)n countries, in the search for national unity, selected one language, generally the former Indo-European colonial language, to be used in government and education. However, in recent years, [Africa](1700)n countries have become increasingly supportive of maintaining linguistic diversity. Language policies that are being developed nowadays are mostly aimed at multilingualism. This presents a methodological complication when collecting data in [Africa](1700) and limited literature exists. An analysis of Afrobarometer public opinion survey data of 36 countries suggested that survey interviewers and respondents could engage in various linguistic behaviors, such as code-switching during the survey. Moreover, some [Africa](1700)n countries have been considering removing their official former Indo-European colonial languages, like Mali and [Burkina Faso](4664) which removed French as an official language in 2024.

Cross-border languages
The colonial borders established by European powers following the Berlin Conference in 1884–1885 divided a great many ethnic groups and [Africa](1700)n language speaking communities. This can cause divergence of a language on either side of a border (especially when the official languages are different), for example, in orthographic standards. Some notable cross-border languages include Berber (which stretches across much of North [Africa](1700) and some parts of West [Africa](1700)), Kikongo (that stretches across northern [Angola](1855), western and coastal Democratic Republic of the Congo, and western and coastal Republic of the Congo), Somali (stretches across most of the Horn of [Africa](1700)), Swahili (spoken in the [Africa](1700)n Great Lakes region), Fula (in the Sahel and West [Africa](1700)) and Luo (in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan).
Some prominent [Africa](1700)ns such as former Malian president and former Chairman of the [Africa](1700)n Commission, Alpha Oumar Konaré, have referred to cross-border languages as a factor that can promote [Africa](1700)n unity.

Language change and planning
Language is not static in [Africa](1700) any more than on other continents. In addition to the (likely modest) impact of borders, there are also cases of dialect levelling (such as in Igbo and probably many others), koinés (such as N'Ko and possibly Runyakitara) and emergence of new dialects (such as Sheng). In some countries, there are official efforts to develop standardized language versions.
There are also many less widely spoken languages that may be considered endangered languages.

Demographics
Of the 1 billion [Africa](1700)ns (in 2009), about 17 percent speak an [Arabic](4233) dialect. About 10 percent speak Swahili, the lingua franca of Southeast [Africa](1700); about 5 percent speak a Berber dialect; and about 5 percent speak Hausa, which serves as a lingua franca in much of the Sahel. Other large West [Africa](1700)n languages are Yoruba, Igbo, Akan and Fula. Major Horn of [Africa](1700) languages are Somali, Amharic and Oromo. Lingala is important in Central [Africa](1700). Important South [Africa](1700)n languages are Sotho, Tswana, Pedi, Venda, Tsonga, Swazi, Southern Ndebele, Zulu, Xhosa and [Afrikaans](1787).
French, English, and Portuguese are important languages in [Africa](1700) due to colonialism. About 320 million, 240 million and 35 million [Africa](1700)ns, respectively, speak them as either native or secondary languages. Portuguese has become the national language of [Angola](1855) and São Tomé and Príncipe, and Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique.

Linguistic features
Some linguistic features are particularly common among languages spoken in [Africa](1700), whereas others are less common. Such shared traits probably are not due to a common origin of all [Africa](1700)n languages. Instead, some may be due to language contact (resulting in borrowing) and specific idioms and phrases may be due to a similar cultural background.

Phonological
Some widespread phonetic features include:

certain types of consonants, such as implosives (/ɓa/), ejectives (/kʼa/), the labiodental flap and in southern [Africa](1700), clicks (/ǂa/, /ᵑǃa/). True implosives are rare outside [Africa](1700), and clicks and the flap almost unheard of.
doubly articulated labial-velar stops like /k͡pa/ and /ɡ͡ba/ are found in places south of the Sahara.
prenasalized consonants, like /mpa/ and /ŋɡa/, are widespread in [Africa](1700) but not common outside it.
sequences of stops and fricatives at the beginnings of words, such as /fsa/, /pta/ and /dt͡sk͡xʼa/.
nasal stops which only occur with nasal vowels, such as ba vs. mã (but both pa and pã), especially in West [Africa](1700).
vowels contrasting an advanced or retracted tongue, commonly called "tense" and "lax".
simple tone systems which are used for grammatical purposes.
Sounds that are relatively uncommon in [Africa](1700)n languages include uvular consonants, diphthongs and front rounded vowels
Tonal languages are found throughout the world but are especially common in [Africa](1700) - in fact, there are far more tonal than non-tonal languages in [Africa](1700). Both the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoi-San phyla are fully tonal. The large majority of the Niger–Congo languages are also tonal. Tonal languages are also found in the Omotic, [Chad](4691)ic and South & East Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic. The most common type of tonal system opposes two tone levels, High (H) and Low (L). Contour tones do occur, and can often be analysed as two or more tones in succession on a single syllable. Tone melodies play an important role, meaning that it is often possible to state significant generalizations by separating tone sequences ("melodies") from the segments that bear them. Tonal sandhi processes like tone spread, tone shift, downstep and downdrift are common in [Africa](1700)n languages.

Syntactic
Widespread syntactical structures include the common use of adjectival verbs and the expression of comparison by means of a verb 'to surpass'. The Niger–Congo languages have large numbers of genders (noun classes) which cause agreement in verbs and other words. Case, tense and other categories may be distinguished only by tone. Auxiliary verbs are also widespread among [Africa](1700)n languages; the fusing of subject markers and TAM/polarity auxiliaries into what are known as tense pronouns are more common in auxiliary verb constructions in [Africa](1700)n languages than in most other parts of the world.

Semantic
Quite often, only one term is used for both animal and meat; the word nama or nyama for animal/meat is particularly widespread in otherwise widely divergent [Africa](1700)n languages.
