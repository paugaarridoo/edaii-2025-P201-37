Amenemhat IV
See Amenemhat, for other individuals with this name.

[Amenemhat I](3759)V (also known as Amenemhet IV) was the seventh and penultimate king of the late Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt during the late Middle Kingdom period. He arguably ruled around 1786–1777 BC for about nine regnal years.
[Amenemhat I](3759)V may have been the son, grandson, son-in-law, or stepson of his predecessor, the powerful [Amenemhat I](3759)II. His reign started with a seemingly peaceful two-year coregency with [Amenemhat I](3759)II. He undertook expeditions in the Sinai for turquoise, in Upper Egypt for amethyst, and to the Land of Punt. He also maintained trade relations with Byblos as well as continuing the Egyptian presence in Nubia. 
[Amenemhat I](3759)V built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai, and constructed the well-preserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi. The tomb of [Amenemhat I](3759)V has not been identified, although the Southern Mazghuna pyramid is a possibility. 
[Amenemhat I](3759)V was succeeded by Sobekneferu, who may have been his sister or stepsister; she was a daughter of [Amenemhat I](3759)II. Her reign marked the end of the Twelfth Dynasty and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom's decline into the Second Intermediate Period.

Family
[Amenemhat I](3759)V's mother was a woman named Hetepi. Hetepi's only known attestation is an inscription on the wall of the temple of Renenutet at Medinet Madi, where she is given the title of "King's Mother", but not the titles of "King's Wife", "King's Daughter", or "King's Sister". She may or may not have been a wife of [Amenemhat I](3759)II, as her titles in relation to [Amenemhat I](3759)II might have been omitted in an inscription from her son's reign.
The relationship of [Amenemhat I](3759)V to [Amenemhat I](3759)II is debated. [Amenemhat I](3759)V was the son of [Amenemhat I](3759)II according to Manetho, but as he isn't called a "King's Son" in any known reference to him, some historians believe that he was a grandson. However, there is no record of another son of [Amenemhat I](3759)II and as stated above, Hetepti is not known to have been called a "King's Daughter".
Manetho states that [Amenemhat I](3759)V married his sister Sobekneferu, who is identified as a royal daughter of [Amenemhat I](3759)II, and who eventually ruled in her own right upon the death of [Amenemhat I](3759)V. However, Manetho's claim about the marriage has not been proven correct; Sobekneferu is not known to have borne the title of "King's Wife" among her other titles. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt has alternatively proposed that before marrying [Amenemhat I](3759)II, Hetepi had been previously married to another man and that [Amenemhat I](3759)V came from this marriage, thus becoming Sobekneferu's stepbrother – which could explain the Manethonian tradition.
[Amenemhat I](3759)V may have died without a male heir, which could explain why he was succeeded by Sobekneferu. This is also disputed, as some Egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have proposed that the first two rulers of the Thirteenth Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, might be his sons, based on the filiative nomen Amenemhat.

Reign
The Turin Canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period, records [Amenemhat I](3759)V on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. [Amenemhat I](3759)V is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.
In spite of the Turin canon, the duration of [Amenemhat I](3759)V's reign is uncertain. It was given as eight years under the name Ammenemes in Manetho's Aegyptiaca. In any case, [Amenemhat I](3759)V's rule seems to have been peaceful and uneventful. [Amenemhat I](3759)V is well attested by contemporary artefacts, including a number of scarab- and cylinder-seals.

Coregency
[Amenemhat I](3759)V first came to power as a junior coregent of his predecessor [Amenemhat I](3759)II, whose reign marks the apex of the Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where the names of the two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars believe it was only two years long.

Expeditions
The Sinai
Four expeditions to the turquoise mines of Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai are dated to his reign by in-situ inscriptions. The latest took place in his ninth year on the throne and could be the last expedition of the Middle Kingdom, since the next inscription dates to [Ahmose I](3733)'s reign, some 200 years later.
In his 2nd regnal year, [Amenemhat I](3759)V sent another expedition to mine amethyst in the Wadi el-Hudi in southern Egypt. The leader of the expedition was the assistant treasurer Sahathor. Farther south, three nilometer records are known from Kumna in Nubia that are explicitly dated to regnal years 5, 6, and 7, showing that Egyptian presence in the region was maintained during his lifetime.

Byblos
During his reign, important trade relations must have existed with the city of Byblos on the coast of modern-day Lebanon, where an obsidian and gold chest as well as a jar lid bearing [Amenemhat I](3759)V's name have been found. A gold plaque showing [Amenemhat I](3759)V offering to a deity may also originate there.

Mersa Gawasis
In 2010, a report on continuing excavations at Wadi Gawasis on the Red Sea coast notes the finding of two wooden chests and an ostracon inscribed with a hieratic text mentioning an expedition to the fabled Land of Punt in regnal year 8 of [Amenemhat I](3759)V, under the direction of the royal scribe Djedy. Two fragments of a stela depicting [Amenemhat I](3759)V and dating to his regnal year 7 were found at Berenice on the Red Sea.

Building activities
[Amenemhat I](3759)V completed the temple of Renenutet and Sobek at Medinet Madi that had been started by [Amenemhat I](3759)II. It is "the only intact temple still existing from the Middle Kingdom" according to Zahi Hawass, former Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA). The foundations of the temple, administrative buildings, granaries, and residences were uncovered by an Egyptian archaeological expedition in early 2006. It is possible that [Amenemhat I](3759)V built a temple in the northeastern Fayum at Qasr el-Sagha.
[Amenemhat I](3759)V is responsible for the completion of a shrine at the temple of Hathor in the Sinai and may also have undertaken works in Karnak where a pedestal for a sacred barque inscribed with the names of [Amenemhat I](3759)II and [Amenemhat I](3759)V was found in 1924.

Tomb
The tomb of [Amenemhat I](3759)V has not been identified. It is likely he built his pyramid near those of his predecessors. Some pyramid remains have been connected to [Amenemhat I](3759)V.
1 He often is associated with the ruined Southern Mazghuna pyramid. No inscriptions have been found within the pyramid to determine the identity of its owner, but its architectural similarity with the second pyramid of [Amenemhat I](3759)II at Hawara has led Egyptologists to date the pyramid to the late Twelfth Dynasty or early Thirteenth Dynasty. Less likely, [Amenemhat I](3759)V could have been interred in [Amenemhat I](3759)II's first pyramid in Dahshur, since his name has been found on an inscription in the mortuary temple.
2 At Dahshur, next to the pyramid of [Amenemhat I](3759)I, the remains of another pyramid dating to the Middle Kingdom were discovered during building work. The pyramid has not yet been excavated, but a fragment inscribed with the royal name "Amenemhat" has been unearthed. It is possible that this pyramid belongs to [Amenemhat I](3759)V, although there are also kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty that bore the name Amenemhat and who could have built the pyramid. Alternatively, the relief fragment could have originated at the nearby pyramid of [Amenemhat I](3759)I.

Theories
Legacy
Less than ten years after [Amenemhat I](3759)V's death, the Twelfth Dynasty came to an end and was replaced by the much weaker Thirteenth Dynasty. Although the first two rulers of this new dynasty may have been sons of [Amenemhat I](3759)V, political instability quickly became prevalent and kings rarely ruled beyond a couple of years. The influx of Asiatic immigrants in the Nile Delta that had started during the reigns of [Amenemhat I](3759)V's predecessor accelerated under his own reign, becoming completely unchecked. Under the Thirteenth Dynasty, the Asiatic population of the Delta founded an independent kingdom ruled by kings of Canaanite descent, forming the Fourteenth Dynasty that reigned from Avaris. Approximately 80 years after the reign of [Amenemhat I](3759)V, "the administration of the Egyptian state seems to have completely collapsed", marking the start of the Second Intermediate Period.

Dating
Various authors provide different estimates for his reign: AE Chronology (1772–1764), v. Beckerath (1807–1798), Shaw (1786–1777), Dodson (1798–1785), Arnold (1799–1787), Malek (1814–1805), Grimal (1797–1790), Franke (1773–1764), Redford (1798–1790).
