Canadian Soccer Association
The Canadian Soccer Association (French: Association canadienne de soccer; branded as [Canada](1956) Soccer) is the governing body for soccer in [Canada](1956). Headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario, the federation is a full member of FIFA and governs Canadian soccer at the international, professional, and amateur levels, including: the men's and women's national teams, Canadian Premier League, youth organizations, beach soccer, futsal, Paralympic and deaf national teams. The Canadian Soccer Association also administers and operates the Canadian Championship.

History
The Dominion of [Canada](1956) Football Association, today known as the Canadian Soccer Association, was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba in July 1912. The organization joined FIFA on December 31, 1912. On June 21, 1926, the DCFA resigned from FIFA, only to rejoin on June 20, 1948. The governing body of the game retained that name until it was changed to The Football Association of [Canada](1956) on June 6, 1952. The association later changed its name to the Canadian Soccer Football Association in 1958 and then at last to the Canadian Soccer Association in 1971.
[Canada](1956) Soccer has hosted several global soccer tournaments, including the 1976 Olympic football tournament, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and will co-host the [2026 FIFA World Cup](1110) along with Mexico and United States. The association has also hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup (2007), the FIFA U-16 World Championship (1987), and the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup (2002, 2014).

Organization and governance
[Canada](1956) Soccer is a non-profit organization governed by a board of directors consisting of 14 directors: a President, Vice President, six elected directors, and six appointed or independent directors.

Professional leagues
Despite a long history of professional soccer in the country, [Canada](1956) have struggled to build and sustain domestic soccer leagues. They have gone through many different iterations, finally landing on the Canadian Premier League that was founded in 2019.

Men
The Canadian Premier League (CPL) is the top division of soccer in [Canada](1956). It is the only fully professional, and only fully national league in the system. Founded in 2019, the CPL is composed of eight teams and is sanctioned by the CSA. There are also three Canadian teams which play in Major League Soccer, the first-division league sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation, reflecting a longstanding practice of major Canadian sports franchises competing in American leagues.
CSA does not have a sanctioned second-division men's soccer league; however, they do have a third-division sanctioned league: League1 [Canada](1956) which was founded in 2022. League1 [Canada](1956) is contested by clubs from four divisions; these are Ligue1 Québec, League1 Ontario, League1 British Columbia, and League1 Alberta for both the men's and women's divisions. In 2022, Toronto FC II and Whitecaps FC 2 began play in MLS Next Pro, a USSF-sanctioned third-division league.
At the professional level, [Canada](1956)'s domestic cup is the Canadian Championship. Founded in 2008, the Canadian Championship is an annual tournament contested by Canadian professional teams and the champions of each League1 [Canada](1956) division. The winner is awarded the Voyageurs Cup and a berth in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. [Canada](1956)'s best performance in the CONCACAF Champions Cup came in the 2014–15 competition, when Montreal Impact reached the finals. Toronto FC also reached the final in 2018 where they fell in penalties to C.D. Guadalajara.

Women
As of 2023, [Canada](1956) does not have a professional women's league. The CSA previously had an affiliation with the U.S.-based National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) where some [Canada](1956) women's national soccer team players were assigned to NWSL clubs. This affiliation ended after the 2021 season when the allocation system was abolished, although many Canadians continue to play in the American league.
In 2022, former national team player Diana Matheson and then national team captain Christine Sinclair announced a new Canadian women's professional league which will start play in April 2025. Matheson and Project 8 Sports Inc. are leading this effort while Sinclair is involved in an advisory role. 
Six teams are expected to play the inaugural season of the Northern Super League. Halifax Tides FC, AFC Toronto, Calgary Wild FC, Montreal Roses, Ottawa Rapid and Vancouver Rise are expected to take the field in 2025.

Leagues
Lawsuit
In July 2022, an independent review summarized in a 125-page report by McLaren Global Sport Solution, commissioned by [Canada](1956) Soccer, concluded that [Canada](1956) Soccer mishandled sexual harassment allegations in 2008 against then [Canada](1956) U-20 women's soccer coach Bob Birarda, who was later found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. It said [Canada](1956) Soccer was "described by many as being dysfunctional and inefficient" in 2007 and 2008, and concluded among other things that "harassment was not a priority issue amongst the senior Canadian Soccer Association leadership team" at the time.
In 2022, [Canada](1956) Soccer's then newly appointed Secretary General Earl Cochrane said: "We are going to be leaders in this safe sport – through policy, practice, programs."
