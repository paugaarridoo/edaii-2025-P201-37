Swabia (Bavaria)
Swabia (German: Schwaben, Swabian: Schwaabe) is one of the seven administrative regions of [Bavaria](1377), Germany. It consists of ten districts and 340 municipalities (including four cities) with [Augsburg](1344) being the administrative capital. It is the only German region officially named Swabia in the principle of spatiality.

Governance
The county of Swabia is located in southwest [Bavaria](1377). It was annexed by [Bavaria](1377) in 1803, is part of the historic region of Swabia and was formerly ruled by dukes of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. During the Nazi period, the area was separated from the rest of [Bavaria](1377) to become the Gau Swabia. It was re-incorporated into [Bavaria](1377) after the war.
The Regierungsbezirk is subdivided into 3 regions (Planungsregionen): Allgäu, [Augsburg](1344), and Donau-Iller. Donau-Iller also includes two districts and one city of [Baden-Württemberg](4546).

History
The [Bavaria](1377)n administrative region of Swabia is the eastern part of the Duchy of Swabia. After the execution of the Swabian duke Conradin in Naples in 1268, his uncle, the [Bavaria](1377)n duke Louis, inherited some of Conradin's possessions in Swabia. In 1803, with the German Mediatisation, [Bavaria](1377) acquired the further East Swabian territories, which were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg.
After the founding of the Kingdom of [Bavaria](1377), the state was totally reorganised and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative districts (German: Regierungsbezirke), in [Bavaria](1377) called Kreise. They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers. 
In the following years, due to territorial changes (e.g. the loss of Tyrol, the addition of the Palatinate), the number of districts was reduced to 8. The Swabian territories were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg and the new district was called Oberdonaukreis (Upper Danube District). In 1837, king Ludwig I of [Bavaria](1377) renamed all the districts after historical territorial names and tribes of the area. This also involved some border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the name Oberdonaukreis changed to Swabia.
In 1945, the town of Lindau was detached from [Bavaria](1377) by France, but it was reunited with the district of Swabia in 1955. In 1972, the former Swabian city Neuburg an der Donau was reunited with the district of Upper [Bavaria](1377).

Main sites
Next to the capital [Augsburg](1344) and several other old cities including Donauwörth, Nördlingen, Memmingen, Mindelheim, Kaufbeuren and Kempten, the Ottobeuren Abbey and the scenic attractions of the River Danube in the north and the Allgäu in the south with the Allgäu Alps and Oberstdorf and the royal castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein next to Füssen belong to the major attractions. With the district of Lindau, [Bavaria](1377)n Swabia has access to Lake Constance.
