2020 Nobel Peace Prize
The [2020 Nobel Peace Prize](1251) was awarded to the World Food Programme (founded in 1961) by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The announcement was made on Friday 9 October at 11:00 CEST.

Candidates
There were 318 candidates for the [2020 Nobel Peace Prize](1251) (211 individuals and 107 organizations), which is the fourth largest number in the history of the prize. However, the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not reveal the names of nominators nor of the nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize before 50 years have passed. Full professors in relevant academic fields and national-level politicians in any country may propose candidates, and it does not require an invitation to submit a nomination; sometimes nominators make their proposals public, but the committee does not verify nominations.
