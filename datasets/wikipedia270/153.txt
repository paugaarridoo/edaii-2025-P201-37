"A Common Confusion" (German: "Eine allt√§gliche Verwirrung") is a short story by [Franz Kafka](150). It was published posthumously in Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer (Berlin, 1931).

Synopsis
The story details transactions between A and B. A meets B at H and comes home pleased with the events. Following this, he meets B again, but only after a delay to the very same H he arrived at successfully previously. B is not there. To add insult to injury, A learns B had arrived early waiting for him. Thankfully he has an opportunity to explain to B what happened, but in his haste he trips and falls. He hears B above him stomping down the stairs enraged.

Analysis
The story has parallels with the dynamics of the officials within The Castle (novel). Like many of Kafka's characters the good intentions, hard work, and diligence are futile efforts in an indifferent world. Kafka begins the story by stating the events are a "common experience" suggesting the story is an example of a universal rule.
