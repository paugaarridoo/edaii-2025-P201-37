190
Ammu Aahotepre
'Ammu [Aahotepre](190) was a pharaoh of the 14th Dynasty who ruled over parts of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. His reign is believed to have lasted about 15 years, from 1760 BC until 1745 BC.

Attestations
Like other kings of the dynasty, scarab seals are the only surviving evidence for his reign. 'Ammu [Aahotepre](190) has 61 seals bearing his name: 30 for the nomen 'Ammu and 31 for the prenomen [Aahotepre](190).
A scarab bearing the nomen of this king was discovered in Tell el-Ajjul, Gaza Strip and catalogued by Flinders Petrie in 1933.

Identification
Ryholt (1997) identified king 'Ammu with [Aahotepre](190) in his reconstruction of the Turin canon. Von Beckerath (1964) had previously assigned the prenomen [Aahotepre](190) to a pharaoh of the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt.
