Trivia
Michael Jackson was supposed to perform his song "Whatever Happens" from his Invincible album, along with the legendary guitarist Carlos Santana. Unfortunately the performance was cancelled and blocked by Sony Music after conflicts with the company and Jackson.
Lenny Kravitz won his fourth consecutive Grammy award in the Best Male Rock Vocal Performance category for "Dig In", breaking the record for most wins in that category (1999-2002).
The 44th Annual Grammy Awards was the first Grammy show following the September 11 attacks of 2001. As a result, several memorable performances included:
U2's opening performance of "Walk On", which won Record of the Year later on that night
Mary J. Blige's performance of "No More Drama"
Alan Jackson's performance of "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"
Host Jon Stewart also did a skit mocking the new airport security measures put into place following September 11.
